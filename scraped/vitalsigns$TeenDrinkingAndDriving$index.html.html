		<h3>Preventing Teen Drinking and Driving: What Works</h3>
		<div class="subColumns">
		  <div class="subc">
        	              <ul class="bullet-list nolines"><li><strong>Minimum legal drinking age</strong> (MLDA) laws in every state make it illegal to sell alcohol to anyone under age 21. Research has shown that enforcement of MLDA laws using alcohol retailer compliance checks has reduced retail sales of alcohol to those under the legal drinking age.</li><li><strong>Zero tolerance</strong> laws in every state make it illegal for those under age 21 to drive after drinking any alcohol. Research has demonstrated that these laws have reduced drinking and driving crashes involving teens.</li><li><strong>Graduated driver licensing</strong> (GDL) systems help new drivers get more experience under less risky conditions. As teens move through stages, they gain privileges, such as driving at night or driving with passengers. Every state has GDL, but the specific rules vary. Research indicates that GDL systems prevent crashes and save lives.</li><li><strong>Parental involvement</strong>, with a focus on monitoring and restricting what new drivers are allowed to do, helps keep new drivers safe as they learn to drive. Parents can consider creating and signing a parent-teen driving agreement with their teens. Research has shown that when parents establish and enforce the ârules of the roadâ, new drivers report lower rates of risky driving, traffic violations, and crashes.</li></ul>        						  </div>
