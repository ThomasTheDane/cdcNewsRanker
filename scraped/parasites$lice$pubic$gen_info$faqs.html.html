Pubic lice infestation is found worldwide and occurs in all races, ethnic groups, and levels of society.</p><a id="appear" name="appear"><!-- --></a> <h4>What do pubic lice look like?</h4><p>Pubic lice have three forms: the egg (also called a nit), the nymph, and the adult.</p><p><strong>Nit:</strong> Nits are lice eggs. They can be hard to see and are found firmly attached to the hair shaft. They are oval and usually yellow to white. Pubic lice nits take about 6â10 days to hatch.</p><p><strong>Nymph:</strong> The nymph is an immature louse that hatches from the nit (egg). A nymph looks like an adult pubic louse but it is smaller. Pubic lice nymphs take about 2â3 weeks after hatching to mature into adults capable of reproducing. To live, a nymph must feed on blood.</p><p><strong>Adult:</strong> The adult pubic louse resembles a miniature crab when viewed through a strong magnifying glass. Pubic lice have six legs; their two front legs are very large and look like the pincher claws of a crab. This is how they got the nickname "crabs." Pubic lice are tan to grayish-white in color. Females lay nits and are usually larger than males. To live, lice must feed on blood. If the louse falls off a person, it dies within 1â2 days.</p><a id="found" name="found"><!-- --></a> <h4>Where are pubic lice found?</h4><p>Pubic lice usually are found in the genital area on pubic hair; but they may occasionally be found on other coarse body hair, such as hair on the legs, armpits, mustache, beard, eyebrows, or eyelashes. Pubic lice on the eyebrows or eyelashes of children may be a sign of sexual exposure or abuse. Lice found on the head generally are head lice, not pubic lice.</p><p>Animals do not get or spread pubic lice.</p><p class="topOPage"><a href="/parasites/lice/pubic/gen_info/faqs.html">Back To Top</a></p><a id="symptoms" name="symptoms"><!-- --></a> <h4>What are the signs and symptoms of pubic lice?</h4><p class="list-leadIn">Signs and symptoms of pubic lice include</p><ul class="bullet-list nolines"><li>Itching in the genital area</li><li>Visible nits (lice eggs) or crawling lice</li></ul><a id="transmit" name="transmit"><!-- --></a> <h4 class="list-leadOut">How did I get pubic lice?</h4><p>Pubic lice usually are spread through sexual contact and are most common in adults. Pubic lice found on children may be a sign of sexual exposure or abuse. Occasionally, pubic lice may be spread by close personal contact or contact with articles such as clothing, bed linens, or towels that have been used by an infested person. A common misconception is that pubic lice are spread easily by sitting on a toilet seat. This would be extremely rare because lice cannot live long away from a warm human body and they do not have feet designed to hold onto or walk on smooth surfaces such as toilet seats.</p><p>Persons infested with pubic lice should be examined for the presence of other sexually transmitted diseases.</p><a id="diagnosed" name="diagnosed"><!-- --></a> <h4>How is a pubic lice infestation diagnosed?</h4><p>A pubic lice infestation is diagnosed by finding a "crab" louse or egg (nit) on hair in the pubic region or, less commonly, elsewhere on the body (eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, mustache, armpit, perianal area, groin, trunk, scalp). Pubic lice may be difficult to find because there may be only a few. Pubic lice often attach themselves to more than one hair and generally do not crawl as quickly as head and body lice. If crawling lice are not seen, finding nits in the pubic area strongly suggests that a person is infested and should be treated. If you are unsure about infestation or if treatment is not successful, see a health care provider for a diagnosis. Persons infested with pubic lice should be investigated for the presence of other sexually transmitted diseases.</p><p>Although pubic lice and nits can be large enough to be seen with the naked eye, a magnifying lens may be necessary to find lice or eggs.</p><a id="treat" name="treat"><!-- --></a> <h4>How is a pubic lice infestation treated?</h4><p>See our <a href="/parasites/lice/pubic/treatment.html">Treatment</a> page.</p><p class="topOPage"><a href="/parasites/lice/pubic/gen_info/faqs.html">Back To Top</a></p><hr/><p><em>This information is not meant to be used for self-diagnosis or as a substitute for consultation with a health care provider.
