Try to return to your home during the daytime so that you do not have to use any lights. Use battery-powered flashlights and lanterns, rather than candles, gas lanterns, or torches. If you smell gas or suspect a leak, turn off the main gas valve, open all windows, and leave the house immediately. Notify the gas company or the police or fire departments or State Fire Marshal's office, and do not turn on the lights or do anything that could cause a spark. Do not return to the house until you are told it is safe to do so.</p><p>Your electrical system may also be damaged. If you see frayed wiring or sparks, or if there is an odor of something burning but no visible fire, you should immediately shut off the electrical system at the circuit breaker.</p><p>Avoid any downed power lines, particularly those in water. Avoid wading in standing water, which also may contain glass or metal fragments.</p><p><img alt="Photo of water lines on home after waters receded." class="margin-ten fancy-border-right" src="/disasters/floods/images/waterlineonhouse.jpg"/>You should consult your utility company about using electrical equipment, including power generators. Be aware that it is against the law and a violation of electrical codes to connect generators to your home's electrical circuits without the approved, automatic-interrupt devices. If a generator is on line when electrical service is restored, it can become a major fire hazard. In addition, the improper connection of a generator to your home's electrical circuits may endanger line workers helping to restore power in your area. All electrical equipment and appliances must be completely dry before returning them to service. It is advisable to have a certified electrician check these items if there is any question. Also, remember not to operate any gas-powered equipment indoors (see also <a href="/disasters/carbonmonoxide.asp">Carbon Monoxide Poisoning</a> ).</p><p>For more information, see <a href="/disasters/electrical.asp">Protect Yourself and Others From Electrical Hazards After a Disaster</a> and <a href="/disasters/mold/reenter.asp">Reentering Your Flooded Home</a> .</p><p><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="cleanup" name="cleanup" title="Cleanup"></a><span class="toTop"><span class="icon-angle-up"><!-- --></span>Â <a href="#">Top of Page</a></span></p><h2>Cleanup</h2><p>Walls, hard-surfaced floors, and many other household surfaces should be cleaned with soap and water and disinfected with a solution of 1 cup of bleach to five gallons of water. Be particularly careful to thoroughly disinfect surfaces that may come in contact with food, such as counter tops, pantry shelves, refrigerators, etc. Areas where small children play should also be carefully cleaned. Wash all linens and clothing in hot water, or dry clean them. For items that cannot be washed or dry cleaned, such as mattresses and upholstered furniture, air dry them in the sun and then spray them thoroughly with a disinfectant. Steam clean all carpeting. If there has been a backflow of sewage into the house, wear rubber boots and waterproof gloves during cleanup. Remove and discard contaminated household materials that cannot be disinfected, such as wallcoverings, cloth, rugs, and drywall.

However, the rates of diseases that were present before a flood may increase because of decreased sanitation or overcrowding among displaced persons. Increases in infectious diseases that were not present in the community before the flood are not usually a problem. If you receive a puncture wound or a wound contaminated with feces, soil, or saliva, have a doctor or health department determine whether a tetanus booster is necessary based on individual records.</p><p>Specific recommendations for vaccinations should be made on a case-by-case basis, or as determined by local and state health departments.</p><p><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="swift" name="swift" title="Swiftly Flowing Water"></a><span class="toTop"><span class="icon-angle-up"><!-- --></span>Â <a href="#">Top of Page</a></span></p><h2>Swiftly Flowing Water</h2><p>If you enter swiftly flowing water, you risk drowning -- regardless of your ability to swim. Swiftly moving shallow water can be deadly, and even shallow standing water can be dangerous for small children. Cars or other vehicles do not provide adequate protection from flood waters. Cars can be swept away or may break down in moving water.</p><p><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="chemical" name="chemical" title="Chemical Hazards"></a><span class="toTop"><span class="icon-angle-up"><!-- --></span>Â <a href="#">Top of Page</a></span></p><h2>Chemical Hazards</h2><p>Use extreme caution when returning to your area after a flood. Be aware of potential chemical hazards you may encounter during flood recovery. Flood waters may have buried or moved hazardous chemical containers of solvents or other industrial chemicals from their normal storage places.</p><p><img alt="Photo of chemical tanks." class="margin-ten fancy-border-right" src="/disasters/floods/images/chemicaltank.jpg"/>If any propane tanks (whether 20-lb. tanks from a gas grill or household propane tanks) are discovered, do not attempt to move them yourself. These represent a very real danger of fire or explosion, and if any are found, police or fire departments or your State Fire Marshal's office should be contacted immediately.</p><p>Car batteries, even those in flood water, may still contain an electrical charge and should be removed with extreme caution by using insulated gloves. Avoid coming in contact with any acid that may have spilled from a damaged car battery.</p><p>For more information about possible dangers posed by chemical leaks and spills, see the <a href="/chemical/">Chemical Emergencies</a> Web site.</p><p><span class="toTop"><span class="icon-angle-up"><!-- --></span>Â <a href="#">Top of Page</a></span></p>             					            					            						</div>
