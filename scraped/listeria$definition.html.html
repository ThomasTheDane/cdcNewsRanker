                        <h3>What is Listeriosis?</h3>
					  <p>Listeriosis, a serious infection usually caused by eating food contaminated   with the bacterium <em>Listeria monocytogenes </em><sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup>, is an important public   health problem in the United States <sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup>. The disease primarily affects older adults,   pregnant women, newborns, and adults with weakened immune systems <sup><a href="#three">3</a></sup>. However,   rarely, people without these risk factors can also be affected. The risk may be   reduced by following a few simple recommendations.</p>
					
					    <h3>What are the Symptoms of Listeriosis?</h3>
					    <p>A person with listeriosis usually has fever and muscle aches, sometimes   preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. Almost everyone who is   diagnosed with listeriosis has "invasive" infection, in which the bacteria   spread beyond the gastrointestinal tract. The symptoms vary with the infected   person:</p>
					    <ul>
					      <li><strong>Pregnant women</strong>: Pregnant women typically experience fever  and other non-specific symptoms, such as fatigue and aches. However, infections during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage,   stillbirth, premature delivery, or life-threatening infection of the   newborn <sup><a href="#three">3</a>,</sup><sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup>.</li>
					      <li><strong>People other than pregnant women</strong>: Symptoms can include headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and   convulsions in addition to fever and muscle   aches.</li>
				        </ul>
					    <p>Listeriosis can present in different ways<!-- depending on the type of infection. Manifestations of listeriosis  are host-dependent-->. In older adults and people with immunocompromising  conditions, septicemia and meningitis are the most common clinical presentations <sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup>.  Pregnant women may experience a fever  and other non-specific symptoms, such as fatigue and aches, followed by fetal loss  or bacteremia and meningitis in their newborns <sup><a href="#three">3</a>,</sup><sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup>. Immunocompetent people may  experience acute febrile gastroenteritis or no symptoms <sup><a href="#five">5</a>,<a href="#six">6</a></sup>. </p>
