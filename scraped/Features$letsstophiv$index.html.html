Approximately 50,000 Americans become newly infected each year, and an estimated 1.1 million people are now living with HIV. Yet, nearly one in five of these individuals does not know that they are infected.</p><div class="c25r"><div class="subc"><div class="cdc-caption"><img alt="Photo: Let's Stop HIV Together Video" height="130" src="/features/letsstophiv/letsstophiv_b150px.jpg" width="150"/> <p class="cdc-caption-text"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5Uh3Vp55rA" target="_blank">Click here to watch Jamar's story</a></p></div></div></div><ul><li>Learn the basics about HIV and AIDS and learn how to prevent HIV and take steps to protect yourself and others.

Share the HIV Basics page and your new knowledge with your Facebook and Twitter friends.</li></ul><h3>Get Tested</h3><p>According to CDC, nearly one in five persons with HIV doesn't know he or she is infected, and can pass the virus on to others without knowing it. Getting an HIV test, knowing your HIV status, and encouraging your friends, family, and community to do the same are important steps in preventing the spread of HIV.</p><p>Talk with your friends and family about getting tested and protecting themselves. CDC recommends that everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 be tested for HIV at least once as part of routine health care. Testing once a year (or more) is recommended for people at higher risk of HIV infection, such as those who are gay, bisexual, men who have sex with men (MSM), injection drug users, or people with multiple sex partners.</p><p>Here are three good reasons for you to get an HIV test.</p><div class="c33r columns"><div class="subcr"><div class="cdc-caption"><img alt="Photo: Kelly (right) with her friend, Sy" height="267" src="/features/letsstophiv/letsstophiv_c170px.jpg" width="170"/> <p class="cdc-caption-text">Kelly (right) with her friend, Sy</p></div></div></div><ol><li><em>Finding out early can help you live a longer, healthier life.</em> There are treatments now that are available to you that can keep you healthy. You can find support, so that you stay connected to care.</li><li><em>If you know, you can protect yourselfâand the people you love.</em> The earlier you know, the more you can do. There's new hope today for stopping HIV. Medicines (antiretroviral therapy or ART) can lower the level of virus in the body. ART helps people with HIV live longer, healthier lives and also lowers the chances of passing HIV to others. Knowing early enables you to help yourself and to protect others. Studies have shown that when people find out they have HIV, they are also more likely to take steps to protect their health and that of their partners.</li><li><em>It's easy. It's free, fast, and confidential.</em> Many clinics and testing locations in your area offer free HIV tests. You can even get confidential or anonymous HIV tests. To find out where you can get a free HIV test in your area, do one of the following: <ul><li>Use the site locator at <a href="http://hivtest.cdc.gov">http://hivtest.cdc.gov</a>. Enter your ZIP code, and the locator will find a testing site near you.</li><li>Text your local ZIP code to "KNOWIT" (566948), and you will receive a text back with a testing site near you.</li><li>Call 800âCDCâINFO (800â232â4636) to ask for free testing sites in your area.</li></ul></li></ol><h3>Get Involved</h3><div class="c33r columns"><div class="subcr"><div class="cdc-caption" style=" width: 826px;"><img alt="Photo: JosÃ© (center) with his friends" height="267" src="/features/letsstophiv/letsstophiv_d170px.jpg" width="170"/> <p class="cdc-caption-text">JosÃ© (center) with his friends</p></div></div></div><p>A little help can go a long way!
