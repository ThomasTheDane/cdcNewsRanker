More than 360,000 teen girls give birth each year in the United States. One half of teen mothers do not finish high school. While much progress has been made in recent decades, U.S. teen pregnancy and birth rates remain much higher than in other developed nations, and cost U.S. taxpayers more than $9 billion each year.</p><p>Success in preventing teen pregnancies and births requires a sustained commitment to meet the complex challenges facing the nation's youth. As part of the President's Teen Pregnancy Prevention Initiative (TPPI), CDC is partnering with the federal Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (ASH) to reduce teenage pregnancy and address disparities in teen pregnancy and birth rates. The ASH Office of Adolescent Health (OAH) is supporting public and private entities to fund medically accurate and age appropriate evidence-based or innovative program models to reduce teen pregnancy.</p><p>The CDC/OAH initiative recommends strategies that</p><ul><li>Include evidence-based sex education that provides accurate information and supports the needs of teens throughout their development.</li><li>Include efforts to help parents and teens communicate effectively with each other.</li><li>Ensure sexually active teens have access to effective and affordable contraceptives.</li></ul><p>Individuals and organizations from all levels of our communities have important roles to play in reducing teen pregnancy.
