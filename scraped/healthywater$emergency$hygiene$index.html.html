                    <h1>Hygiene &amp; Handwashing</h1>
 
 		<p>Good basic personal hygiene and handwashing are critical to help prevent the spread of illness and disease. Clean, safe running water is essential for proper hygiene and handwashing.</p>
        <p>Hygiene is especially important in an emergency such as a flood, hurricane, or earthquake, but finding clean, safe running water can sometimes be difficult. The following information will help to ensure good hygiene and handwashing in the event of an emergency.</p>
        
        <h3><a name="kit"></a>Disaster Supplies Kit (Hygiene Supplies)</h3>
        <p>Before an emergency, make sure you have created a <a href="/healthywater/emergency/safe_water/personal.html#kit">Disaster Supplies Kit</a>. The CDC and the American Red Cross have prepared a <a href="http://www.redcross.org/preparedness/cdc_english/foodwater-2.asp">shopping list</a> of emergency water, hygiene, and sanitation supplies that should be contained in your kit.</p>
        


        <h3><a name="handwashing"></a>Handwashing</h3>
        <p>Keeping hands clean during an emergency helps prevent the spread of germs. If your tap water is not safe to use, wash your hands with soap and water that has been <a href="/healthywater/emergency/safe_water/personal.html#make_safe_boiling">boiled or disinfected</a>. Follow these steps to make sure you wash your hands properly:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Wet </strong>your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap.</li>
          <li><strong>Lather </strong>your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Be sure to lather the backs of your hands, between your   fingers, and under your nails.</li>
          <li><strong>Scrub</strong> your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the "Happy Birthday" song from beginning to end twice.</li>
          <li><strong>Rinse</strong> your hands well under clean, running water.</li>
          <li><strong>Dry </strong>your hands using a clean towel or air dry them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A temporary <a href="http://www.dec.alaska.gov/eh/fss/Food/Docs/HANDWASHING_STATION.pdf">Handwashing Station [PDF - 1 page]</a> can be created by using a large water jug that contains clean water (for example, boiled or disinfected).</p>
        <h4>When Clean, Running Water is Not Available</h4>
        <p>Washing hands with soap and water is the best way to reduce the number of microbes  on them in most situations. If soap and water are not available, use an  alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Alcohol-based  hand sanitizers can quickly reduce the number of microbes on hands in some  situations, but sanitizers do <strong>not</strong> eliminate all types of germs.</p>
        <p>Hand sanitizers are not as effective when hands are visibly dirty or greasy.</p> 

<p><strong>How do you use hand sanitizers?</strong></p>
 <ul>
   <li>Apply the product to the palm of one hand (read the label to learn the correct amount).</li>
   <li>Rub your hands together. </li>
   <li>Rub the product over all surfaces of your hands and fingers until your hands are dry.</li>
 </ul>
 
 
 <h4>When to Wash Hands</h4>
   
        <p>Wash hands with soap and clean, running water (if available):</p>
        		<ul>
    <li>Before, during, and after preparing food</li>
    <li>Before eating food</li>
    <li>Before and after caring for someone who is sick</li>
    <li>Before and after treating a cut or wound</li>
    <li>After using the toilet</li>
    <li>After changing diapers or cleaning up a child who has used the toilet</li>
    <li>After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing</li>
    <li>After touching an animal, animal feed, or animal waste</li>
    <li>After handling pet food or pet treats</li>
    <li>After touching garbage</li>                
</ul>

        <h3><a name="wound"></a>Wound Care</h3>
