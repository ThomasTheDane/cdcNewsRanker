About 1,600 people in the United States get sick from <em>Listeria</em> each year. While the infection is rare, in 2011, a new sourceâcantaloupes contaminated with <em>Listeria</em>âcaused one of the deadliest foodborne outbreaks in the US.</p><h3>Who May Be at Riskâ¦and Why?</h3><p><em>Listeria</em>, the third leading cause of death from food poisoning, targets pregnant women and their babies, people with weakened immune systems, and those 65 years or older. These hard-hit groups account for at least 90 percent of reported <em>Listeria</em> infections.</p><h4>Pregnant women, fetuses, and newborn infants</h4><p><em>Listeria</em> can pass from a pregnant woman to her fetus or newborn. It can cause miscarriage and stillbirth; in a newborn, it can cause bloodstream infection, meningitis, or death. The risk for pregnant women is ten times higher than for the general population. For Hispanic pregnant women, the risk is 24 times higher. More consumption of Mexican-style soft cheese, like queso fresco, may explain the higher rates among Hispanics.</p><div class="c33r"><div class="subcr"><div class="module rounders">

As an ultrasound technologist working with high-risk pregnancies, Stephanie knew more than most what could go wrong during a pregnancy. She knew the risks of <em>Listeria</em> after seeing its damaging effects firsthand while working at the hospital.</p><p>Unfortunately, Stephanie developed listeriosis, an infection caused by eating <em>Listeria</em>-tainted food. Her beautiful son, Michael, delivered brain dead and unable to breathe on his own, died two days later--another casualty of <em>Listeria</em> food poisoning. (<a href="http://www.stopfoodborneillness.org/content/michael-and-stephanies-story">Read Stephanie's entire story.</a>)</p><h4>People with weakened immune systems</h4><p><em>Listeria</em> can spread through the bloodstream to cause meningitis and often kills. A weakend immune system increases the risk of <em>Listeria</em> infection. Many illnesses can weaken the immune system, including different kinds of cancer, HIV/AIDS, kidney and liver disease. In addition, many medicines can weaken the immune system, including steroids, cancer chemotherapy, and drugs to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. <em>Listeria</em> infection occurs more often in this group than in people with strong immune systems.</p><div class="c33r"><div class="subcr"><div class="module rounders">

While hospitalized, Michael developed <em>Listeria</em> meningitis. He suffered several seizures and was in a coma for 8 weeks.</p><p>Michael underwent several surgeries, spent a month in a long term acute care facility and two months at a neurological rehab hospital. After five months in hospital, he finally came home on February 7, 2012 as a quadriplegic. Michael died 3 weeks later, on his birthday February 21, 2012.
