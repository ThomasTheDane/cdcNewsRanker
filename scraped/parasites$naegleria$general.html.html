Only one species (type) of <em>Naegleria</em> infects people: <em>Naegleria fowleri</em>.</p> <a id="how" name="how"></a> <h4>How does infection with <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> occur?</h4><p><em>Naegleria fowleri</em> infects people when water containing the ameba enters the body through the nose. This typically occurs when people go swimming or diving in warm freshwater places, like lakes and rivers. The <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> ameba then travels up the nose to the brain where it destroys the brain tissue.</p><p>You <strong>cannot</strong> be infected with <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> by <strong>drinking</strong> contaminated water. In very rare instances, <em>Naegleria</em> infections may also occur when contaminated water from other sources (such as inadequately chlorinated swimming pool water or contaminated tap water) enters the nose, for example when people submerge their heads or cleanse their noses during religious practices, and when people irrigate their sinuses (nose) using contaminated tap water.</p> <a id="where" name="where"></a> <h4>Where is <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> found?</h4><p><em>Naegleria fowleri</em> is found around the world. In the United States, the majority of infections have been caused by <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> from freshwater located in southern-tier states. The ameba can be found in:</p><ul><li>Bodies of warm freshwater, such as lakes and rivers</li><li>Geothermal (naturally hot) water, such as hot springs</li><li>Warm water discharge from industrial plants</li><li>Geothermal (naturally hot) drinking water sources</li><li>Swimming pools that are poorly maintained, minimally-chlorinated, and/or un-chlorinated</li><li>Water heaters. <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> grows best at higher temperatures up to 115Â°F (46Â°C) and can survive for short periods at higher temperatures.</li><li>Soil</li></ul><p><em>Naegleria fowleri</em> is not found in salt water, like the ocean.</p><p class="topOPage"><a href="#">Top of Page</a></p> <a id="temp" name="temp"></a> <h4>In what water temperature does <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> cause infection?</h4><p><em>Naegleria fowleri</em> is a heat-loving (thermophilic) microbe. It grows best at higher temperatures up to 115Â°F (46Â°C) and can survive for short periods at higher temperatures. It is less likely to be found in the water as temperatures decline. The ameba can be found in lake or river sediment at temperatures well below where one would find the ameba in the water.</p> <a id="foodsource" name="foodsource"></a> <h4>What is the source of food for <em>Naegleria fowleri</em>?</h4><p><em>Naegleria fowleri</em> eats other microbes like bacteria found in the sediment in lakes and rivers.</p> <a id="swimmingpool" name="swimmingpool"></a> <h4>Can I get a <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> infection from a disinfected swimming pool?</h4><p>No. You cannot get a <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> infection from a properly cleaned, maintained, and disinfected swimming pool.</p> <a id="howcommon" name="howcommon"></a> <h4>How common are <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> infections in the United States?</h4><p><em>Naegleria fowleri</em> infections are rare <a href="#asterisk">*</a>. In the 10 years from 2003 to 2012, 31 infections were reported in the U.S. Of those cases, 28 people were infected by contaminated recreational water, and 3 people were infected after performing nasal irrigation using contaminated tap water.</p> <a id="when" name="when"></a> <h4>When do <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> infections most commonly occur?</h4><p>While infections with <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> are rare, they occur mainly during the summer months of July, August, and September. Infections are more likely to occur in southern-tier states, but can also occur in other locations. Infections usually occur when it is hot for prolonged periods of time, which results in higher water temperatures and lower water levels.</p><p class="topOPage"><a href="#">Top of Page</a></p> <a id="spread" name="spread"></a> <h4>Can infection be spread from one person to another?</h4><p>No. <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> infection cannot be spread from one person to another.</p> <a id="symptoms" name="symptoms"></a> <h4>What are the symptoms of <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> infection?</h4><p><em>Naegleria fowleri</em> causes the disease primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), a brain infection that leads to the destruction of brain tissue. In its early stages, symptoms of PAM may be similar to symptoms of <a href="/meningitis/bacterial.html">bacterial meningitis.</a></p><p>Initial symptoms of PAM start about 5 days (range 1 to 7 days) after infection. The initial symptoms may include headache, fever, nausea, or vomiting. Later symptoms can include stiff neck, confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, loss of balance, seizures, and hallucinations. After the start of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within about 5 days (range 1 to 12 days).</p> <a id="mechanism" name="mechanism"></a> <h4>What is the actual mechanism of death from <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> infection?</h4><p>The infection destroys brain tissue causing brain swelling and death.</p><p><a id="fatalityrate" name="fatalityrate">Â </a></p><h4>What is the fatality rate for an infected person who begins to show signs and symptoms?</h4><p>The fatality rate is over 99%. Only 1 person out of 128 known infected individuals in the United States from 1962 to 2012 has survived.</p><p class="topOPage"><a href="#">Top of Page</a></p> <a id="treatment" name="treatment"></a> <h4>Is there effective treatment for infection with <em>Naegleria fowleri</em>?</h4><p>It is not clear. Several drugs are effective against <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> in the laboratory. However, their effectiveness is unclear since almost all infections have been fatal, even when people were treated with similar drug combinations.</p> <a id="thinksymptoms" name="thinksymptoms"></a> <h4>What should I do if I have been swimming or playing in freshwater and now think I have symptoms associated with <em>Naegleria fowleri</em>?</h4><p>Infection with <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> is rare. The early symptoms of <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> infection are similar to those caused by other more common illnesses, such as <a href="/meningitis/bacterial.html">bacterial meningitis.</a> People should seek medical care immediately whenever they develop a sudden onset of fever, headache, stiff neck, and vomiting, particularly if they have been in warm freshwater recently.</p> <a id="howcommonenvironment" name="howcommonenvironment"></a> <h4>How common is <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> in the environment?</h4><p><em>Naegleria fowleri</em> is commonly found in lakes in southern-tier states during the summer. This means that recreational water users should be aware that there will always be a low level risk of infection when entering these waters. In very rare instances, <em>Naegleria</em> has been identified in water from other sources such as inadequately chlorinated swimming pool water or heated and contaminated tap water. <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> grows best at higher temperatures up to 115Â°F (46Â°C) and can survive for short periods at higher temperatures.</p> <a id="routinetesting" name="routinetesting"></a> <h4>Is there a routine and rapid test for <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> in the water?</h4><p>No. It can take weeks to identify the ameba, but new detection tests are under development. Previous water testing has shown that <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> is commonly found in freshwater venues. Therefore, recreational water users should assume that there is a low level of risk when entering all warm freshwater, particularly in southern-tier states.</p><p class="topOPage"><a href="#">Top of Page</a></p> <a id="howcompare" name="howcompare"></a> <h4>How does the risk of <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> infection compare with other water-related risks?</h4><p>The risk of Naegleria fowleri infection is very low. There have been 31 reported infections in the U.S. in the 10 years from 2003 to 2012, despite millions of recreational water exposures each year. By comparison, in the ten years from 1996 to 2005, there were more than 39,000 drowning deaths in the U.S.</p> <a id="behaviors" name="behaviors"></a> <h4>What swimming behaviors have been associated with <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> infection?</h4><p>Behaviors associated with the infection include diving or jumping into the water, submerging the head under water or engaging in other water-related activities that cause water to go up the nose.</p> <a id="publicknow" name="publicknow"></a> <h4>How will the public know if a lake or other water body has <em>Naegleria fowleri</em>?</h4><p>Recreational water users should assume that <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> is present in warm freshwater in southern-tier states. Posting signs based on finding <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> in the water is unlikely to be an effective way to prevent infections. This is because:</p><ul><li><em>Naegleria fowleri</em> occurrence is common, infections are rare.</li><li>The relationship between finding <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> in the water and the occurrence of infections is unclear</li><li>The location and number of amebae in the water can vary over time within the same lake or river.</li><li>There are no rapid, standardized testing methods to detect and quantitate <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> in water.</li><li>Posting signs might create a misconception that bodies of water without signs or non-posted areas within a posted water body are <em>Naegleria fowleri</em>-free.</li></ul> <a id="reducerisk" name="reducerisk"></a> <h4>How can I reduce the risk of infection with <em>Naegleria fowleri</em>?</h4><p><em>Naegleria fowleri</em> infects people when water containing the ameba enters the body through the nose. Infection is rare and typically occurs when people go swimming or diving in warm freshwater places, like lakes and rivers. Very rarely, infections have been reported when people submerge their heads, cleanse their noses during religious practices, or irrigate their sinuses (nose) using contaminated tap or faucet water. <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> can grow in pipes, hot water heaters, and water systems, including treated public drinking water systems.</p><p>Personal actions to reduce the risk of <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> infection should focus on limiting the amount of water going up the nose and lowering the chances that <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> may be in the water.</p><p>Please visit the following pages for information on lowering your risk of infection in specific situations:</p><ul><li><a href="/parasites/naegleria/sinus-rinsing.html">Sinus Rinsing &amp; Neti Pots</a></li><li><a href="/parasites/naegleria/ritual-ablution.html">Ritual Nasal Rinsing &amp; Ablution</a></li><li><a href="/parasites/naegleria/public-water-systems.html">Public Drinking Water Systems</a></li></ul><p class="topOPage" style=" clear: right;"><a href="#">Top of Page</a></p><hr/><p><em>This information is not meant to be used for self-diagnosis or as a substitute for consultation with a health care provider.
