Quitting at any age has benefits.</li><li>A majority of Americans who have ever smoked have already quit; you can too.</li></ul><p><strong>Why is it so hard to quit smoking?</strong></p><ul class="bullet-list nolines"><li>Nicotine is a highly addictive drug. Addiction keeps people smoking even when they want to quit.</li><li>Cigarettes deliver more nicotine more quickly now than ever before.</li><li>The tobacco industry spends about $9.94 billion each year, or $27 million every day, on cigarette advertising and promotionâ72% of these dollars are spent on discounts to offset tobacco taxation and other tobacco control policies.</li></ul><p><strong>What's the most effective way to quit smoking?</strong></p><ul class="bullet-list nolines"><li>Different ways work for different people. Many smokers have to try multiple times before they're able to quit for good. It is important to keep trying until you succeed; each time you learn something that will help you quit for good.</li><li>While you're trying to quit, nicotine and non-nicotine containing medications can help lessen the urge to smoke. Talk to your health care provider for help.</li><li>Individual, group, or telephone counseling can double your likelihood of success. A combination of medication and counseling is more effective than medication or counseling alone.</li><li>Smokers can receive free resources and assistance to help them quit by calling 1-800-QUIT-NOW (1-800-784-8669) or visiting <a href="http://www.smokefree.gov" target="_blank">www.smokefree.gov</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>The more states invest in comprehensive tobacco control programs, the greater the reductions in smokingâand the longer they invest, the greater and faster the impact.</strong></p><ul class="bullet-list nolines"><li>California's adult smoking rate has dropped nearly 50% and the number of cigarettes smoked per person has decreased by 67% since the state began the nation's longest-running tobacco control program in 1988.</li><li>California saved $86 billion in health care costs by spending $1.8 billion on tobacco control, a 50:1 return on investment over its first 15 years of funding its tobacco control program.</li></ul><!-- ### /PROBLEM ### --></div></div>
