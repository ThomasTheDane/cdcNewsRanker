It's a popular goal and many, many people succeed. There are more former smokers in the United Statesânearly 50 millionâthan current smokers. Planning ahead can help make your healthy resolution a reality. Two good resources to help you quit are <a href="http://www.smokefree.gov/" target="_blank">www.smokefree.gov</a> and 1-800-QUIT-NOW (1-800-784-8669), where you can get free advice and support.</p><p>For inspiration, look to successful quitters. Beatrice, a busy mother of two boys, shared <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/stories/beatrice.html">her quit story</a> in CDC's <em>Tips From Former Smokers</em> campaign. Smoking seemed cool at age 13, when she started smoking regularly. By her 30s, Beatrice's family begged her to quit.</p><h3>How Does Smoking Hurt Your Health?</h3><div class="righty" style=" width: 260px;"><div class="module rounders">

Hundreds are toxic, and about 70 cause cancer.</li><li>Smoking causes immediate damage to the body.</li><li>Tobacco use causes an estimated 443,000 deaths each year. It kills more people every year than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), illegal drugs, alcohol abuse, car crashes, suicides, and murders <em>combined</em>.</li><li>For every person who dies from a tobacco-related disease, another 20 people live with a serious smoking-related illness.</li></ul><p>People who stop smoking can greatly reduce their risk for disease and early death. The younger you are when you quit, the better your chances of avoiding health problems.</p><h3>Save Your Breath</h3><p>Most cases of the serious lung disease called COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) are caused by smoking. COPD makes it harder and harder to breathe. The disease can make people too sick to work and lead to an early death. When you quit smoking, you can:</p><ul><li>Reduce your coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath</li><li>Reduce your risk of developing COPD</li><li>Slow the weakening of your lungs, if you already have some damage</li></ul><div class="righty" style=" width: 260px;"><div class="module rounders">

	</div></div><p>Michael is an Alaska Native who lives with severe COPD from smoking. He learned the hard way that COPD can disable smokers in the prime of life. Michael shares his story in CDCâs <i>Tips From Former Smokers</i> campaignâand hopes that his suffering will encourage smokers to quit.</p><p>When you quit smoking, you also help protect your children, family, and friends from exposure to secondhand smoke. It can cause immediate harm to those who breathe it.</p><h3>No One Said Quitting Would Be Easy</h3><p>Quitting smoking can be challenging. Most people make multiple attempts. That's because nicotine is a very addictive drug. But don't give up trying just because you haven't succeeded in the past.</p><p>Think about your past attempts to quitâwhat worked and what didn't. If one method didn't work, don't hesitate to try another method. You can learn something new every time you try. This time might be time you quit for good!</p><h3>Choose the Best Quit Method for You</h3><p>Many effective quit methods are available. The science-based strategies listed below have worked for many people:</p><h3>Prepare Ahead and Change Your Routines</h3><ul><li>Prepare for the day you plan to quit. Think about your environment and what you need to change. Get rid of all tobacco products (and other items such as ashtrays) in your home, car, and where you work.</li><li>Don't let people smoke around you. Ask them not to use tobacco near you or leave cigarettes and other tobacco products where you can see them.</li><li>When you first try to quit, change your routine. Use a different route to work. Eat breakfast in a different place. Do something to reduce your stress. Try to distract yourself when you feel an urge to smoke or use tobacco. Talk to someone, go for a walk, exercise, or read a book. Plan something enjoyable to do every day.</li></ul><h3>Let Others Help You</h3><ul><li>Get support from other people. There are many ways to do this. For example, tell your family, friends, and coworkers that you are going to quit and that you want their support. Studies have shown that you have a better chance of being successful if you have help.</li></ul><p>Consider signing up for individual, group, or telephone counseling. Counseling doubles your chances for success. Counseling can help you identify and overcome situations that trigger the urge to smoke. Free programs are available at local hospitals and health centers. Call your local health department for information about programs in your area. Telephone counseling is also available free of charge across the United States at 1-800-QUIT-NOW (1-800-784-8669).</p><h3>Talk to Your Doctor or Health Care Provider</h3><ul><li><img alt="Photo: Female doctor smiling" class="stroke righty" height="247" src="/features/smokingcessation/smokingcessation_a200px.jpg" width="200"/>Talk to your health care provider (e.g., doctor, dentist, nurse, pharmacist, psychologist, or smoking cessation coach or counselor), especially if you want to consider using medications. Medications can help you stop smoking and lessen the urge to smoke.</li><li>Over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapies, or NRTs, can help. These are medications that contain nicotine to help reduce your cravings and withdrawal symptoms so you can focus on changing the behavior and habits that trigger your urge to smoke. Some NRTs are available without a doctor's prescription, including nicotine lozenges, nicotine gum, and nicotine patches.</li><li>You can also get a prescription from your doctor for NRTS, such as nicotine inhalers and nasal sprays, which act much like the over-the-counter NRTs.</li><li>Other prescription medicationsâlike bupropion SR and varenicline tartrateâdo not contain nicotine and work in different ways to help reduce your urge to smoke. These medications are FDA-approved and proven to be effective in helping smokers to quit.</li></ul><p>Quit counseling can be combined with over-the-counter or prescription medications. This combination works better than either method alone.</p><p>Regardless of how you decide to quitâwhether you use medicines, counseling, or simply stop smoking on your ownâit's most important to commit to quit, make a plan, and stick with it.</p><div style=" clear: both;"></div><h3 id="moreInfo">More Information</h3><ul><li><a href="http://smokefree.gov/" target="_blank">Smokefree.gov</a></li><li>1-800-QUIT-NOW (1-800-784-8669)</li><li><a href="http://espanol.smokefree.gov/talkToExpert.aspx" target="_blank" title="Link to non-CDC Web site">1-855-DÃJELO-YA (1-855-335-3569</a>)</li><li><a href="http://women.smokefree.gov/" target="_blank">Women.Smokefree.gov</a></li><li><a href="http://teen.smokefree.gov/" target="_blank">Teen.Smokefree.gov</a></li><li><a href="http://espanol.smokefree.gov/" target="_blank">Espanol.smokefree.gov</a></li><li><a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/patients-consumers/prevention/lifestyle/tobacco/helpsmokers.pdf" target="_blank">Help for Smokers and Other Tobacco Users [PDF - 180KB]</a></li><li><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/">Tips From Former Smokers</a></li><li><a href="http://betobaccofree.hhs.gov/index.html" target="_blank">BeTobaccoFree.gov</a></li><li><a href="http://www.ucanquit2.org/" target="_blank" title="Link to non-CDC Web site">Quit TobaccoâMake Everyone Proud</a> (for military staff, veterans, and families)</li></ul></div> 																</div>
