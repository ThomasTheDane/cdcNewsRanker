<h2><a name="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2>
	<p>Although the effects of obesity on children’s physical health are well 
	documented, the social consequences of obesity are less well described and 
	may not be addressed in intervention programs. Weight bias may take several 
	forms. It may result in teasing and discrimination and may affect 
	employment and educational opportunities. Health care providers may limit 
	care of overweight or obese children. The media promote weight bias in multiple 
	ways. Some parents are biased against their obese children. In an effort to 
	avoid weight bias, new efforts to reduce obesity must be evaluated to determine whether these efforts do, in fact, add to the problem. It is 
	important to understand that the weight bias that obese youth face is just 
	as serious as the physical consequences of excessive weight on the welfare 
	of the child.</p>

<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>The obesity epidemic continues in the United States. Although the effects of 
obesity on the physical health of children are well documented, the emotional 
and social consequences of obesity are less detailed and not as well understood, 
and therefore are often ignored. The emotional consequences of obesity include 
low self-esteem, negative body image, and clinical depression (1). Any action 
or policy that exacerbates these consequences is considered a serious ethical 
problem. Obesity affects social health as well. These social effects often 
take the form of weight bias or stigma. This article summarizes what is known 
about weight bias based on selected reports. It is not intended to be a review 
of the literature. I hope that the opinions offered will increase interest in 
weight bias and its effects on children and 
generate further discussion.</p>

<h2><a name="Bias"></a>Weight Bias</h2>
<p><i>Weight bias</i> can be defined as the inclination to form unreasonable 
judgments based on a persons weight. <i>Stigma</i> is the social sign that is 
carried by a person who is a victim of prejudice and weight bias. Obese children 
are at an increased risk for bias as a result of their weight.</p>
<p>Weight bias is caused by a general belief that stigma and shame will motivate 
people to lose weight or the belief that people fail to lose weight as a result 
of inadequate self-discipline or insufficient willpower. Our culture may not 
punish people who practice weight bias because our culture values thinness (1). 
Society frequently blames the victim rather than addressing environmental 
conditions that contribute to obesity.</p>
<p>Weight bias affects the child in multiple ways. Obese children are often the 
brunt of teasing or discrimination. Bias exists in the adult workplace and 
may affect children as they enter the workforce. Weight bias also influences 
educational success and may affect how health care is delivered. Weight bias is 
promoted in the media and even by parents of obese children. Curbing the obesity 
epidemic will require new strategies that do not result in bias or prejudice.</p>

<h2><a name="Teasing"></a>Weight Bias and Teasing</h2>
<p>Teasing, a potential problem for all youth, is especially a problem for 
overweight and obese youth regardless of racial or ethnic group. In a study by van den 
Berg et al, one-quarter to one-half of children teased by family or peers were 
bothered by it, and more white females were disturbed than were people in other 
groups (2). Asian American adolescents may experience somewhat less 
weight-biased teasing from peers and more weight-biased teasing from 
family members. Efforts to eradicate weight bias can provide benefits to a sizeable 
number of adolescents across different racial/ethnic groups (2).</p>
 
 
<p class="psmall"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h2><a name="Discrimination"></a>Weight Bias and Discrimination</h2>
<p>Perceived weight and height discrimination have increased from 1995-1996 to 2004-2006, 
from 7% to 12% (3). During this same period, perceived racial/ethnic 
discrimination has remained stable, and the prevalence of weight and height 
discrimination has increased to levels that are now comparable with those reported 
for race and age discrimination (3).</p>
<p>Three hypotheses may explain the increase in weight discrimination. First, 
rates of obesity have escalated during the same period. Second, perceived weight 
discrimination may reflect experiences that have resulted from worsening 
societal attitudes and the acceptance of weight bias. Third, the media contribute 
and encourage weight bias and discrimination.</p>
<p>Information that emphasizes personal responsibility as the principal cause of 
obesity worsens negative stereotypes and increases bias toward obese people (4). 
Obese people are more likely to be blamed and negatively stereotyped when they 
are perceived by others to be personally responsible for their weight gain; 
however, they receive more favorable evaluations and less blame when obesity can 
be attributed to a physical cause outside of their personal control, especially 
among children (5).</p>
 
 
<p class="psmall"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h2><a name="Employment"></a>Weight Bias and Employment</h2>
<p>Weight bias against obese adults in the workplace has been widely reported 
(6,7). Although studies involving children in the workplace do not exist, obese 
children are at great risk of becoming obese adults and, therefore, are at risk 
for bias in the workplace. Compared with job applicants who have similar 
qualifications, obese applicants are rated more negatively and are less likely 
to be hired. Obese applicants are also perceived to be unfit for jobs involving 
face-to-face interactions. Overweight and obese applicants are viewed as having 
inadequate self-discipline, low supervisory potential, unacceptable personal 
hygiene, and less ambition and productivity (6). As a consequence, overweight 
and obese employees earn 1% to 6% less than normal-weight people in comparable 
positions, and this salary difference is greater for obese women than obese men 
(7).</p>
<p>Obese people are promoted less often and are sometimes viewed by their employers and 
coworkers as lazy, less competent than their peers, and lacking self-discipline 
(8). Obese people believe they can be fired or suspended because of their 
weight, despite demonstrating satisfactory job performance, even when weight is 
unrelated to their job responsibilities (9).</p>
 
 
<p class="psmall"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h2><a name="Education"></a>Weight Bias and Education</h2>
<p>Teachers perceive overweight students to be untidy, overly emotional, less 
likely to succeed at work, and more likely to have family problems compared with 
their normal-weight peers (10). Forty-three percent of
principals<b>
</b>agree that most people are uncomfortable when they associate with obese 
people (11). In addition, teachers have lower expectations for overweight 
students compared with thinner students across a range of ability areas (12). 
Obese students are less likely to be accepted for admission into college, 
despite having comparable academic performance (13). These facts may explain why obese students feel a bias 
during their educational experiences.</p>
<p>Approximately 1 in 3 overweight females and 1 in 4 overweight males report 
being teased by peers at school; among the heaviest group of youth, that figure 
increases to 3 in 5 (1). Peers regard obese children as undesirable 
playmates who are lazy, stupid, ugly, mean, and unhappy (1). Negative attitudes 
begin in preschool and can worsen as children age (14). As a consequence, obese 
elementary school children miss more days of school than do their nonobese peers 
(15). Obese adolescent females are less likely to attend college than are nonobese females (16). Students who were obese at age 16 years had fewer years 
of education compared with nonobese peers, and youth who are victimized because 
of their weight are more vulnerable to depression, low self-esteem, inferior 
body image, and suicidal thoughts (17). Weight-biased teasing makes the youngster 
more likely to engage in unhealthful eating habits and to avoid physical activity 
in school (1).</p>
 
 
<p class="psmall"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h2><a name="Health"></a>Weight Bias and Health Care Discrimination</h2>
<p>In a study of 400 doctors, 1 in 3 listed obesity as a condition to which they 
responded negatively. Doctors ranked obesity right behind drug addiction, 
alcoholism, and mental illness. They also associated obesity with noncompliance, 
hostility, dishonesty, and inadequate hygiene (18). Consequently, overweight 
patients may be reluctant to seek medical care, may cancel or delay medical 
appointments, or may postpone seeking important preventive services (19). Doctors 
examining overweight patients spend less time with them, engage in less 
discussion, are reluctant to perform preventive health screenings, and do fewer 
interventions (20). Self-monitoring — teaching the patient in a positive way to 
learn to monitor diet and activity to achieve weight maintenance or gradual 
weight loss — should be distinguished from making overweight and obese children 
feel guilty about personal habits related to weight gain. Educational efforts 
should be directed to health care providers to make them aware of the potential 
negative role they may play by giving negative messages.</p>
 
 
<p class="psmall"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h2><a name="Media"></a>Weight Bias and the Media</h2>
<p>Childrens media have a prevailing tendency to represent positive messages 
about being thin and negative messages about being overweight. In childrens 
entertainment, thin characters are ascribed desirable attributes and dominate 
central roles (21), whereas overweight characters are onscreen rarely or in 
minor stereotypical roles. Compared with thin characters appearing on 
television, heavier characters rarely are portrayed in romantic relationships 
(and never with thin characters), are more likely to be objects of humor and 
ridicule, and often engage in stereotypical eating behaviors (22).</p>
 
 
<p class="psmall"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h2><a name="Parents"></a>Weight Bias and Parents</h2>
<p>In a study of 5-year-old girls, parents who were overweight (60% of 
mothers and 82% of fathers) or obese (28% of mothers and 31% of fathers) were 
just as likely to endorse negative stereotypes as were thinner parents (23). Girls 
were more likely than boys to display negative stereotypes if their parents emphasize the 
importance of thin body shape and weight loss. Fathers with higher education and 
income were more likely to endorse stereotypes than were fathers with less 
education and income, as were parents who 
reported a strong investment in their own appearance compared with parents who 
did not (23).</p>
<p>In 1 study, weight-biased teasing by family members was reported by 47% of 
substantially overweight females and 34% of substantially overweight males (1). 
Bias from parents may have unexpected consequences. Studies among high school 
seniors have demonstrated that overweight females receive less financial support 
from their parents for college than do average-weight females, even after 
controlling for parental income, race/ethnicity, family size, and education 
(24).</p>

 
<p class="psmall"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h2><a name="Disorders"></a>Weight Bias, Prevention, and Eating Disorders</h2>
<p>As increased attention is paid to the obesity epidemic it would be unethical 
to, at the same time, increase weight bias. Efforts to promote environmental and policy changes to decrease overeating and inactivity 
(including banning competitive foods from schools, mandating menu labeling, reporting students 
body mass index to parents, and requiring daily physical 
education) are met with concern that these activities may lead to an increase 
in societal preoccupation with dietary restraint and worsening body image, 
thereby increasing weight bias and the incidence of eating disorders (25). Data 
demonstrate, however, that recent societal focus on obesity prevention has not 
led to a discernible increase in eating and eating disorder behavior, and no 
evidence exists that increased media or professional discussions regarding 
childhood obesity have been associated with a concomitant increase in eating pathologies (25).</p>
 
 
<p class="psmall"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h2><a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The obesity epidemic continues to spread at an alarming rate. Preventing 
childhood obesity has become a priority in an effort to improve the nation’s 
health. The reduction of weight bias is just as important as the reduction of 
body mass index is. Children need adults to advocate for them and to fight against weight bias, 
especially as new interventions are developed. Although the effects of weight 
bias are not as well known, the consequences are just as serious as excessive weight 
is on the welfare of the child. Future studies are 
needed to better understand bias, especially the effect it has on the education 
and employment of children. Additional research is needed to determine how best 
to educate teachers and health care providers so that they do not add bias as 
they interact with obese children.</p>
