<h1>Falls Among Older Adults: An Overview</h1>
</div></div>
<div class="syndicate"><div class="mSyndicate"> 
<p>Each year, one in  every three adults age 65 and older falls.<span class="super">1</span> Falls can cause moderate  to severe injuries, such as hip fractures and head traumas, and can increase  the risk of early death. Fortunately, falls are a public health problem that is  largely preventable.</p>
<h2><a id="1" name="1"></a>How  big is the problem?</h2>
<ul>
     <li>One  out of three older adults (those aged 65 or older) falls each year<span class="super">1</span> but  less than half talk to their healthcare providers about it.<span class="super">2</span></li>
     <li>Among  older adults, falls are the leading cause of both fatal and nonfatal injuries.<span class="super">3</span></li>
     <li>In  2010, 2.3 million nonfatal fall injuries among older adults were treated in  emergency departments and more than 662,000 of these patients were  hospitalized.<span class="super">3</span></li>
     <li>In 2010, the direct medical costs of falls, adjusted for  inflation, was $30 billion.<span class="super">4</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="2" name="2"></a>What  outcomes are linked to falls?</h2>
</div></div>
<div class="syndicate"><div class="mSyndicate"> 
<ul>
        <li>Twenty  to thirty percent of people who fall suffer moderate to severe injuries such as  lacerations, hip fractures, or head traumas.<span class="super">5,6 </span>Â These injuries can make it hard to get around  or live independently, and increase the risk of early death.</li>
        <li>Falls  are the most common cause of traumatic brain injuries (TBI).<span class="super">5</span> Â </li>
        <li>In  2000, 46% of fatal falls among older adults were due to TBI.<span class="super">7</span></li>
        <li>Most  fractures among older adults are caused by falls.<span class="super">8</span> The most common are fractures of the spine,  hip, forearm, leg, ankle, pelvis, upper arm, and hand.<span class="super">9</span></li>
        <li>Many  people who fall, even if they are not injured, develop a fear of falling.<span class="super">10</span> This fear may cause them to limit their activities, which leads to reduced  mobility and loss of physical fitness, and in turn increases their actual risk  of falling.<span class="super">11</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="3" name="3"></a>Who  is at risk?</h2>
<p><strong>Fall-related Deaths</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The  death rates from falls among older men and women have risen sharply over the  past decade.<span class="super">3</span></li>
  <li>In 2010,  about 21,700 older adults died from unintentional fall injuries.<span class="super">3</span></li>
  <li>Men  are more likely than women to die from a fall. After taking age into account,  the fall death rate in 2010 was 40% higher for men than for women.<span class="super">3</span></li>
  <li>Older  whites are 2.4 times more likely to die from falls as their black counterparts.<span class="super">3</span></li>
  <li>Rates  also differ by ethnicity. Older non-Hispanics have higher fatal fall rates than  Hispanics.<span class="super">12</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fall Injuries</strong></p>
<ul>
     <li>People  age 75 and older who fall are four to five times more likely than those age 65  to 74 to be admitted to a long-term care facility for a year or longer.<span class="super">13</span></li>
     <li>Rates  of fall-related fractures among older women are more than twice those for men.<span class="super">14</span></li>
     <li>Over  95% of hip fractures are caused by falls.<span class="super">15</span> In 2010, there were 258,000  hip fractures and the rate for women was almost twice the rate for men.<span class="super">17</span></li>
     <li>White  women have significantly higher hip fracture rates than black women.<span class="super">17</span></li>
</ul>
</div></div>
<div class="syndicate"><div class="mSyndicate"> 
<p>Older adults can stay independent and reduce their  chances of falling.<span class="super">18,19</span> They can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Exercise regularly. It is important       that the exercises focus on increasing leg strength and improving balance,       and that they get more challenging over time. Tai Chi programs are especially       good. </li>
        <li>Ask their doctor or pharmacist to       review their medicinesâboth prescription and over-the counterâto identify       medicines that may cause side effects or interactions such as dizziness or       drowsiness. </li>
        <li>Have their eyes checked by an eye       doctor at least once a year and update their eyeglasses to maximize their       vision.  Consider getting a pair with single vision distance lenses       for some activities such as walking outside. </li>
        <li>Make their homes safer by reducing tripping hazards,  adding grab bars inside and outside the tub or shower and next to the toilet,  adding railings on both sides of stairways, and improving the lighting in their  homes.</li>
</ul>
<p>To lower their  hip fracture risk, older adults can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Get adequate calcium and vitamin D—from food and/or from  supplements. </li>
  <li>Do weight bearing exercise. </li>
     <li>Get screened and, if needed, treated       for osteoporosis. </li>
</ul>
