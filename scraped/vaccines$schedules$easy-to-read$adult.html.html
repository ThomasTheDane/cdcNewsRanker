           <h2 class="special_hdr">Why Might Some Adults Need Vaccines?</h2>
           	<p>Some adults incorrectly assume that the vaccines they received as children will protect them for the rest of their lives. Generally this is true, except that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Some adults were never vaccinated as children</li>
        <li> Newer vaccines were not available when some adults were children</li>
        <li> Immunity can begin to fade over time</li>
        <li> As we age, we become more susceptible to serious disease caused by common infections (such as flu and pneumococcus)</li>
      </ul>

      <a name="form"></a><h2 class="special_hdr">Screening Form </h2>
      <h3>Determine which vaccines you need and when to get them</h3>
      	<p>It can sometimes be difficult to understand or keep track of exactly which vaccines you need. Use the following form to help you understand what vaccines might be important for you. Questions on the form help you and your doctor decide which vaccines you need and when to get them. You can print the form, fill it out, and take it with you to the office the next time you see your doctor. </p>
