Quitting smoking greatly reduces the risk of developing smoking-related diseases.</p><p>Tobacco/nicotine dependence is a condition that often requires repeated treatments, but effective treatments and helpful resources exist. Smokers can and do quit smoking. In fact, today there are more former smokers than current smokers.<sup>1</sup></p><h3 class="stu_section" id="dependence">Nicotine Dependence</h3><ul><li>Nicotine is the drug in tobacco products that produces dependence.<sup>2,3,4,5</sup> Most smokers are dependent on nicotine.<sup>2,3</sup></li><li>Nicotine dependence is the most common form of chemical dependence in the United States.<sup>6</sup> Research suggests that nicotine may be as addictive as heroin, cocaine, or alcohol.<sup>1,3,5</sup></li><li>Quitting smoking is difficult and may require several attempts.<sup>3,4</sup> Users often return to smoking because of withdrawal symptoms, stress, and weight gain.<sup>2,3,4</sup></li><li>Nicotine withdrawal symptoms may include irritability, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, cravings for a cigarette, and increased appetite.<sup>2,3</sup></li></ul><h3 class="stu_section" id="benefits">Health Benefits of Quitting</h3><p>Tobacco smoke contains a deadly mix of more than 7,000 chemicals; hundreds are toxic, and about 70 can cause cancer.<sup>1,3,7</sup> Tobacco smoking increases the risk for serious health problems, numerous diseases, and death.<sup>1,3</sup></p><p>People who stop smoking greatly reduce their risk for disease and premature death. Although the health benefits are greater for people who stop at earlier ages, quitting is beneficial at all ages.<sup>1,3,8,9</sup></p><p><span class="emphasis">Stopping smoking is associated with the following health benefits:</span><sup>1,3,8,9</sup></p><ul><li>Lowered risk for lung cancer and many other types of cancer.</li><li>Reduced risk for coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease.</li><li>Reduced coronary heart disease risk within 1 to 2 years of quitting.</li><li>Reduced respiratory symptoms, such as coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. The rate of decline in lung function is slower among people who quit smoking than among those who continue to smoke.</li><li>Reduced risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), one of the leading causes of death in the United States.</li><li>Reduced risk for infertility in women of reproductive age. Women who stop smoking during pregnancy also reduce their risk of having a low birth weight baby.</li></ul><h3 class="stu_section" id="quitting">Smokers' Attempts to Quit</h3><p>Among current U.S. adult cigarette smokers, 68.8% report that they want to quit completely.<sup>10</sup> Starting in 2002, the number of former smokers has exceeded the number of current smokers.<sup>10</sup></p><h4 class="stu">Percentage of adult daily cigarette smokers who stopped smoking for more than 1 day in 2010 because they were trying to quit:</h4><br/><ul><li class="arrow1"><span class="highlight">42.7%</span> of <span class="highlight">all <span class="emphasis">adult</span> smokers<sup>10</sup></span></li><li class="arrow1"><span class="highlight">48.5%</span> of <span class="highlight">smokers aged <span class="emphasis">18â24</span> years<sup>10</sup>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â </span></li><li class="arrow1"><span class="highlight">46.8%</span> of <span class="highlight">smokers aged <span class="emphasis">25â44</span> years<sup>10</sup>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â </span></li><li class="arrow1"><span class="highlight">38.8%</span> of <span class="highlight">smokers aged <span class="emphasis">45â64</span> years<sup>10</sup>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â </span></li><li class="arrow1"><span class="highlight">34.6%</span> of <span class="highlight">smokers aged <span class="emphasis">65</span> years or older<sup>10</sup>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â </span></li></ul><h4 class="stu">Percentage of high school cigarette smokers who ever tried to stop smoking in the past 12 months:</h4><br/><ul><li class="arrow1"><span class="highlight">50.8%</span> of <span class="highlight">all high school students who smoke<sup>11</sup></span></li></ul><h3 class="stu_section" id="methods">Methods to Quit Smoking</h3><p><span class="emphasis">The majority of cigarette smokers quit without using evidence-based treatments.<sup>10</sup></span> <span class="emphasis">However, the following treatments are proven to be effective for smokers who want help to quit:</span></p><ul><li>Brief clinical interventions (i.e., when a doctor takes 10 minutes or less to deliver advice and assistance about quitting)<sup>2</sup></li><li>Individual, group, or telephone counseling<sup>2</sup></li><li>Behavioral therapies (e.g., training in problem solving)<sup>2</sup></li><li>Treatments with more person-to-person contact and intensity (e.g., more or longer counseling sessions)<sup>2</sup></li><li>Programs to deliver treatments using mobile phones<sup>12</sup></li></ul><p><span class="emphasis">Medications for quitting that have been found to be effective include the following</span>:</p><ul><li>Nicotine replacement products<sup>2</sup> <ul><li>Over-the-counter (nicotine patch [which is also available by prescription], gum, lozenge)</li><li>Prescription (nicotine patch, inhaler, nasal spray)</li></ul></li><li>Prescription non-nicotine medications: bupropion SR (Zyban<sup>Â®</sup>)<sup>2</sup>, varenicline tartrate (Chantix<sup>Â®</sup>).<sup>2,13</sup></li></ul><p>Counseling and medication are both effective for treating tobacco dependence, and <span class="emphasis">using them together is more effective than using either one alone</span>.<sup>2</sup></p><h3 class="stu_section" id="resources">Helpful Resources</h3><br/><h4 class="stu">Quitline Services</h4><p><a href="http://smokefree.gov/">1-800-QUIT-NOW</a> (1-800-784-8669) is a <span class="emphasis">free</span> telephone support service that can help individuals who want to stop smoking or using tobacco.
