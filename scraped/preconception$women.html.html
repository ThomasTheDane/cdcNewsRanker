This is because part of preconception health is about people getting and staying healthy overall, throughout their lives.</p><p>One of the best things a woman can do for herself is to take good care of her health. Itâs natural to think about eating well and exercising as important parts of being healthy, but there are other things to consider, too. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urges all women to make healthy living a priority.</p><p>In addition, no one expects an unplanned pregnancy. But it happens often. In fact, about half of all pregnancies in the United States are not planned.</p><p>Following are some healthy habits for women:</p><h3>1.
