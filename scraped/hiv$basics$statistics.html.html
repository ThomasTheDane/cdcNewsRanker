						            <p>A. About 50,000 people get infected with HIV each year. Â In 2010, there were around 47,500 new HIV  infections in the United States. </p>

						      <h4>Q. How many people are living with HIV in the United States?</h4>
						        <div class="inner">
						            <p>A. About 1.1 million people in the United States were living  with HIV at the end of 2010, the most recent year this information was  available. Of those people, about 16% do not know they are infected.</p>

                                        <p>A. CDC estimates the number of people living with HIV (called <em>prevalence</em>) by using a scientific model.  This model helps CDC estimate the number of new HIV infections and how many  people are infected but don’t know it. HIV prevalence is the number of people  living with HIV infection at a given time, such as at the end of a given year.  <a href="/hiv/pdf/2011_Monitoring_HIV_Indicators_HSSR_FINAL.pdf">More information on HIV prevalence</a>.</p>

                             <h4>Q. How does HIV affect different groups of people?</h4>
					          <div class="inner">
				                <p>A. There are different ways to answer this question.</p>
						              <p> If we look at HIV infection by <strong>race and ethnicity</strong>, we see that African Americans are most affected  by HIV. In 2010, African Americans made up only 12% of the US population, but had  44% of all new HIV infections. Additionally, Hispanic/Latinos are also strongly  affected. They make up 17% of the US population, but had 21% of all new HIV  infections. </p>
                                <div align="center"><br/>
                                <img alt="Pie chart title: New HIV Infections by Race/Ethnicity, 2010. Of the 47,500 new HIV infections in 2010: 44% were in African Americans; 31% were in Whites; 21% were in Hispanic/Latinos; 2% were in Asians; 1% were in those of multiple races; Less than 1% were in American Indians/Alaska Natives; Less than 1% were in Native Hawaiians/Other Pacific Islanders" height="355" src="/hiv/images/web/statistics_basics_new_infections_by_race_550x355.jpg" width="550"/></div>
                                <p>If we look at HIV infections by how people got the virus (<em>transmission category)</em>, we see that men  who have sex with men (MSM) are most at risk. In 2010, MSM had 63% of all new  HIV infections, even though they made up only around 2% of the population.  Individuals infected through heterosexual sex made up 25% of all new HIV  infections in 2010.</p>
                                <div align="center"><br/>
                                <img alt="Pie chart title: New HIV Infections by Transmission Category, 2010. Of the 47,400 new HIV infections in 2010: 63% were due to male to male sex; 25% were due to heterosexual contact; 8% were due to injection drug use; 3% were due to male to male sex and injection drug use" height="345" src="/hiv/images/web/statistics_basics_new_infections_by_trans_550x345.jpg" width="550"/></div>
                                <p>Combining those two views allows us to see the most affected  populations, by race and by risk factor. <br/>

                                  <strong>Figure1: Estimated New HIV Infections in the United States, 2010, for the Most Affected Subpopulations</strong><br/>
                                <img alt="This bar chart shows the number of new HIV infections in 2010 for the most-affected sub-populations. The most new infections occurred among white men who have sex with men, or MSM, (11,200) followed by black MSM (10,600), Hispanic MSM (6,700), black heterosexual women (5,300), black heterosexual men (2,700), white heterosexual women (1,300), Hispanic heterosexual women (1,200), black male injection drug users, or IDU, (1,100) and black female IDU (850)." height="319" src="/hiv/images/web/statistics_incidence_graph_550x319.jpg" width="550"/></div>
<p>There are also variations by age. <strong>Young people</strong>, aged 13-24 are especially affected by HIV. They  comprised 16% of the US population, but accounted for 26% of all new HIV  infections in 2010. All young people are not equally at risk, however. Young MSM,  for example, accounted for 72% of all new infections in people aged 13-24, and  young, African American MSM are even more severely affected.</p>

						      <div class="inner">
						              <p>A. Yes. In the United States, about 15,500 people with AIDS died in 2010. HIV  disease remains a significant cause of death for certain populations. To date,  more than 635,000 individuals with AIDS in the United States have died.</p>

						      <div class="inner">
						                  <p>A. Yes. HIV is largely an urban disease, with most cases  occurring in metropolitan areas with 500,000 or more people. The South has the  highest number of individuals living with HIV, but when you take population  size into account, the Northeast has the highest rate of persons living with  new HIV infections. (Rates are the number of cases of disease per 100,000  people. Rates allow comparisons between two groups of different sizes.)</p>

						      <div class="inner">
						                  <p>A. HIV disease continues to be a serious health issue for  parts of the world. Worldwide, there were about 2.5 million new cases of HIV in  2011. About 34 million people are living with HIV around the world. In 2011,  there were about 17 million deaths in persons with AIDS, and nearly 30 million  people with AIDS have died worldwide since the epidemic began. Even though  Sub-Saharan Africa bears the biggest burden of HIV/AIDS, countries in South and  Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and those in Latin America are  significantly affected by HIV and AIDS.</p>
