								<h2>Elderly at risk of hospitalizations from key medications </h2>
                                
                                <h4><em>Promoting safe use of blood thinners and diabetes medications can protect patients</em></h4>
                               
<p>Each year, there are nearly 100,000 emergency hospitalizations for <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/MedicationSafety/basics.html">adverse  drug events</a> in U.S. adults aged 65 years or older,  according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study published today in the <a href="http://www.nejm.org/">New England Journal of Medicine</a>. Of the thousands  of medications available to patients, a small group of blood thinners and  diabetes medications caused two–thirds of the emergency hospitalizations, the  report said.Â Â  </p>
<p>“These  data suggest that focusing safety initiatives on a few medicines that commonly  cause serious, measurable harms can improve care for many older Americans,” said  Dan Budnitz, M.D., M.P.H., director of CDC′s <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/medicationsafety">Medication Safety Program</a>. “Blood  thinners and diabetes medicines often require blood testing and dosing changes,  but these are critical medicines for older adults with certain medical conditions.Â  Doctors and patients should continue to use  these medications but remember to work together to safely manage them.” </p>
<p>The  study used data collected between 2007 and 2009 from a nationally representative  sample of 58 hospitals participating in CDC′s National Electronic Injury  Surveillance System–Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance project.Â Almost  half (48.1 percent) of these hospitalizations occur among adults aged 80 years  or older, and two–thirds (65.7 percent) of the hospitalizations were due to  overdoses, or to situations in which patients may have taken the prescribed  amount of medication but the drug had more than the intended effect on the  patient′s body.Â  </p>
<p>Four  medications, used alone or together, accounted for two–thirds of the emergency  hospitalizations:</p>

<ul>
<li>33  percent, or 33,171 emergency hospitalizations, involved <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682277.html">warfarin</a>, a medication  used to prevent blood clots.</li>
  <li>14  percent involved <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682611.html">insulin</a>s.Â  Insulin injections are used to control blood  sugar in people who have diabetes. </li>
  <li>13  percent involved <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/bloodthinners.html">antiplatelet  drugs</a>,  such as aspirin or clopidogrel, which prevent <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/plateletdisorders.html">platelets</a>, or pieces of  blood cells <a id="_GoBack" name="_GoBack"></a>from clumping together to start a clot. </li>
  <li>11  percent involved diabetes medications that are taken by mouth, called <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002588.htm">oral  hypoglycemic agents</a>.</li>Â  </ul>
  
<p>This  study identified specific medication safety issues that provide the greatest  opportunities for reducing patient harm and health care utilization today.Â  Continued national monitoring of adverse drug  events will be important as new medications are approved and become more  commonly used.</p>
<p>CDC  scientists noted medications currently identified by <a href="http://www.ncqa.org/tabid/59/default.aspx">national quality measures</a> as being  high–risk or potentially inappropriate for older patients were rarely identified  as the cause of emergency hospitalizations (1.2 percent and fewer than 6.6 percent,  respectively). Â </p>
<p>“Policies  and improvement programs to promote safe use of medications that most commonly  cause serious, measureable harms can increase patient safety and reduce  unnecessary hospitalizations and costs at the same time,” said Patrick Conway,  M.D., M.Sc., chief medical officer of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid  Services and director of CMS′ Office of Clinical Standards and Quality.Â “We are working across the federal government  to address common preventable adverse drug events through medication  management, <a href="https://www.cms.gov/demoprojectsevalrpts/md/itemdetail.asp?itemid=CMS1239313">care transition  programs</a>,  and other initiatives.”</p>
<p>One initiative, the <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/compare/partnership–for–patients/">Partnership for  Patients</a>,  includes an effort to decrease the number of preventable rehospitalizations by 20 percent by the end of 2013.Â  Older  adults are nearly seven times as likely as younger people to have adverse drug  events that require hospitalization. Hospitalizations for adverse drug events have  the potential to increase as Americans live longer, have greater numbers of  chronic conditions, and take more medications. Decreasing adverse drug events,  including those from blood thinners and diabetes medications, is a key area of focus  for the Partnership for Patients. </p>
