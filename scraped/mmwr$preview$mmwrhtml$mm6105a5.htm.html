				<p>Each year, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) publishes immunization schedules for persons aged 0 through 18 years. These schedules summarize recommendations for currently licensed vaccines for children aged 0 through 6 years and 7 through 18 years and include recommendations in effect as of December 23, 2011.</p>
				<p>Vaccination providers are being advised to use all three schedules (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>, <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>, and <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>) and their respective footnotes together and not separately. </p>
				<p>A parent-friendly schedule for children and adolescents is available online at <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/child-schedule.htm#printable">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/child-schedule.htm#printable</a>.</p>
				<p>Changes to the previous schedules include the following:</p>
				<ul>
                <li>Updates to Figure 1 ("Recommended immunization schedule for persons aged 0 through 6 years"): 
				<br/> — Quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4) purple bar has been extended to reflect licensure of MCV4-D (Menactra) use in children as young as age 9 months. 
				<br/> — A wording change has been introduced in the hepatitis A (HepA) vaccine yellow bar; wording now states, "Dose 1." A new yellow and purple bar has been added to reflect HepA vaccine recommendations for children aged 2 years and older.
                </li>
				<li> Guidance is provided for administration of hepatitis B (HepB) vaccine in infants with birthweights &lt;2,000 grams and â¥2,000 grams. Clarification is provided for doses after administration of the birth dose of HepB vaccine.</li>
				<li> Rotavirus (RV) vaccine footnotes have been condensed.</li>
				<li> <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine footnotes have been condensed, and use of Hiberix for the booster (final) dose has been clarified. Guidance for use of Hib vaccine in persons aged 5 years and older in the catch-up schedule has been updated. </li>
				<li> Pneumococcal vaccine footnotes have been condensed. </li>
				<li> Guidance is provided for use of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine in infants aged 6 through 11 months. Footnotes in the catch-up schedule have been condensed. </li>
				<li> HepA vaccine footnotes have been updated to clarify that the second dose of HepA vaccine should be administered 6–18 months after dose 1.</li>
				<li> MCV4 footnotes have been updated to reflect recent recommendations published in <i>MMWR</i>. </li>
				<li> Influenza vaccine footnotes have been updated to provide guidance on live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) contraindications. </li>
				<li> Influenza vaccine footnotes also have been updated to clarify dosing for children aged 6 months through 8 years for the 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons.</li>
				<li> Figure 2 ("Recommended immunization schedule for persons aged 7 through 18 years") has been updated to include number of doses for each vaccine. Information regarding the recommended age (16 years) for the booster dose of MCV4 has been added. </li>
				<li> Tdap vaccine recommendations for children aged 7 through 10 years have been updated. </li>
				<li> Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine footnotes have been updated to include routine recommendations for vaccination of males.</li>
				<li> Varicella (VAR) vaccine footnotes have been condensed. </li>
				<li> Inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) footnotes have been updated to include upper age limit for routine vaccination. IPV footnotes in the catch-up schedule have been condensed, and relevant wording added to Figure 3 ("Catch-up immunization schedule for persons aged 4 months through 18 years who start late or who are more than 1 month behind"). </li>
				<li> In the catch-up immunization schedule, HepA vaccine and HepB vaccine footnotes have been removed. Relevant wording has been added to Figure 3.</li>
				<li> MCV4 vaccine has been added to Figure 3 along with corresponding footnotes.</li>
                </ul>
