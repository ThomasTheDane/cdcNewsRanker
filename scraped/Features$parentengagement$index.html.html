The answers aren't simple, and many factors are involved, including effective parenting, stable and healthy living conditions, and individual character traits (e.g., high self-esteem and positive and resilient temperament). Education and public health professionals are increasingly interested in examining these factorsâoften called protective factorsâto understand which characteristics or situations are most likely to help teens make safer, healthier choices.</p><p><em>Parent engagement in schools</em>, one of our promising protective factors, is defined as parents and school staff working together to support and improve the learning, development, and health of children and adolescents.<sup><a href="#references">1,2</a></sup></p><h3>What Does the Research Say?</h3><p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force has found sufficient evidence to recommend interventions to improve parenting skills as an effective way to modify adolescents' risk and protective behaviors.<sup><a href="#references">3</a></sup> One such skill is for parents to be engaged in their children's lives.</p><p><img alt="Photo: Father preparing daughter and son for school" class="stroke righty" height="139" src="/features/parentengagement/parentengagement_a200px.jpg" width="200"/>A growing body of research shows that adolescents engage in fewer health risk behaviors and perform better academically when their parents are actively involved in their lives. Parent engagement in schools can promote positive health behaviors among children and adolescents. Students who have parents engaged in their school lives are less likely to smoke cigarettes<sup><a href="#references">4</a></sup>; drink alcohol<sup><a href="#references">5</a></sup>; become pregnant<sup><a href="#references">6</a></sup>; become sexually active<sup><a href="#references">7</a></sup>; and be emotionally distressed.<sup><a href="#references">6</a></sup> In addition, health interventions that include a parent engagement component have been shown to increase positive health behaviors such as children's school-related physical activity.<sup><a href="#references">8</a></sup></p><p>Research also shows a strong relationship between parent engagement and educational outcomes, including school attendance<sup><a href="#references">9</a></sup> and higher grades and classroom test scores.<sup><a href="#references">10</a></sup> In turn, students who do well academically are less likely to engage in such risky behaviors as smoking cigarettes, carrying weapons, drinking alcohol, or having sexual intercourse.<sup><a href="#references">11-12</a></sup></p><h3>What Can Schools and Families Do to Promote Parent Engagement in School Health?</h3><p>CDC researchers have created <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/AdolescentHealth/pdf/parent_engagement_strategies.pdf">Parent Engagement: Strategies for Involving Parents in School Health [PFD - 2.10MB]</a>, which identifies the following <strong>evidence-based strategies</strong> for teachers, administrators, school staff, and parents to use to increase parent engagement in school health:</p><ol><li><strong>Support a positive <em>connection</em> with parents.</strong> <ul><li>Â <img alt="Photo: Parent Engagement -
