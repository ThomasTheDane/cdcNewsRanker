Place them in a locked cabinet where children canât reach them.</li><li>Buy pain and fever medicines that say <strong>âchildrenâsâ</strong> on the label. Also, look for the words âacetaminophenâ or âibuprofenâ on the label.</li><li>Call the doctor if your child is very small or very large for his or her age so you will be sure to give the right amount of medicine. The dose you give your child depends on the childâs age and weight.</li><li>Use a special medicine spoon, dropper, or the cap that came with the medicine. Wash the cap, dropper, or spoon with soap and water after each use.</li><li>Donât give cough or cold medicines to children younger than 4 years of age.</li></ul><h3>Warning</h3><p><strong>Think your child age 18 or younger might have the flu?</strong></p><p><strong>Never give them aspirin or products with aspirin in them.</strong></p><p>Check <strong>all</strong> medicine labels to make sure they do not contain aspirin, also called salicylate. Although it mostly affects people age 18 or younger, Reyeâs Syndrome can strike anyone who takes aspirin products when they have the flu.</p><p>Reyeâs Syndrome is a rare, serious illness than can affect the blood, liver, and brain of someone who has recently had a flu virus. This illness can cause confusion, seizures, or coma. Talk to your childâs doctor about signs and symptoms of Reyeâs Syndrome.</p> 																</div>
