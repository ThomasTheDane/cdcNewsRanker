                <h2>Gradual drop in youth tobacco use continues, but significant problem areas remain</h2>
                <p><em>Surgeon General's Report outlines key steps to further reducing tobacco use among youth</em></p>
                <p>Tobacco use among American  middle school and high school students showed a slow decline from 2000 to 2011,  according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and PreventionÂ  But when compared with other long-term  studies, such as the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, the steep rate of decline from  1997 to 2003 has slowed noticeably. The  report published today shows that in 2011 nearly 30 percent of high school  males and 18 percent of high school females used some form of tobacco. More  than 8 percent of middle school males and nearly 6 percent of middle school  females used some form of tobacco in 2011.</p>
                <p>The report indicates that though  tobacco use continued an 11-year downward trend, tobacco use remains high among  high school students. For example, among  black high school students, cigar use increased significantly from 7.1 percent in 2009 to 11.7 percent in 2011. In 2011, cigar use among high school males  (15.7 percent) was comparable to cigarette use (17.7 percent).Â Cigar use includes the use of cigarette-like  cigars that can be packaged and smoked like typical cigarettes, but are taxed  at a lower rate, making them more appealing and accessible to youth.Â  While they contain the same toxic chemicals as  cigarettes, no cigars are subject to restrictions on flavorings and misleading  descriptors such as “light” or “low tar,” according to the report.</p>
                <p>Nearly 25 percent  of high school males and more than 17 percent of high school females used some  form of smoked tobacco product in 2011, while smokeless tobacco use among high school males  (12.9 percent) was 8 times higher than among high school females (1.6 percent).</p>
                <p>“An  overall decline in tobacco use is good news, but although 4 out of 5 teens  don't smoke, far too many kids start to smoke every day,” said CDC Director  Thomas R. Frieden, M.D., M.P.H.Â  “Most  tobacco use begins and becomes established during adolescence. This report is  further evidence that we need to do more to prevent our nation’s youth from establishing  a deadly addiction to tobacco.”<br/>
                  <br/>
                  The study, “Current Tobacco Use Among Middle and High School StudentsâUnited  States, 2011,” published in this week’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report reported  no significant declines in the use of any tobacco product among middle school  students from 2009 to 2011. Â However, cigarette  use declined from 19.2 percent in 2009 to 15.8 percent among Hispanic high  school students. </p>
                <p>The report  reaffirms the need to return youth tobacco use trends to the more rapid rate of  decline seen from the late 1990s through 2003. To further reduce tobacco use  among young people, the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/2012/">2012 Surgeon General’s Report</a> recommends making tobacco products less  affordable, running hard-hitting mass media campaigns, and evidence-based  tobacco control and prevention programs that work in conjunction with new  restrictions on the sale, distribution, and marketing of cigarettes and other  tobacco products to youth.</p>
                <p>Tobacco use  remains the leading cause of preventable death and disease in the United  States.  Cigarette use and exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke kill an  estimated 443,000 Americans each year.Â  The  health consequences of tobacco use include heart disease, multiple types of  cancer, lung disease, adverse reproductive effects, and the worsening of  chronic health conditions.  Yet nearly 4,000 kids under age 18 try their  first cigarette every day.Â  In addition  to the cost in human lives, cigarette smoking has been estimated to cost $193  billion annually in direct health care expenses and lost productivity. </p>
