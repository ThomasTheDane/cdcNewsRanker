                    <h4 class="faqQuestion">What is campylobacteriosis?</h4>
                    <p>Campylobacteriosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria of the genus <em>Campylobacter</em>. Most people who become ill with campylobacteriosis get diarrhea, cramping, abdominal pain, and fever within two to five days after exposure to the organism. The diarrhea may be bloody and can be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The illness typically lasts about one week. Some infected persons do not have any symptoms. In persons with compromised immune systems, <em>Campylobacter</em> occasionally spreads to the bloodstream and causes a serious life-threatening infection.</p>

                    <h4 class="faqQuestion">How common is <em>Campylobacter</em>?</h4>
                    <p><em>Campylobacter</em> is one of the  most common causes of diarrheal illness in the United States. Most cases occur  as isolated, sporadic events, not as part of recognized outbreaks. Active  surveillance through the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network  (FoodNet) indicates that about 14 cases are diagnosed each year for each  100,000 persons in the population. Many more cases go undiagnosed or  unreported, and campylobacteriosis is estimated to affect over 1.3 million  persons every year. Campylobacteriosis occurs much more frequently in the  summer months than in the winter. The organism is isolated from infants and  young adults more frequently than from persons in other age groups and from  males more frequently than females. Although <em>Campylobacter</em> infection  does not commonly cause death, it has been estimated that approximately 76  persons with <em>Campylobacter</em> infections die each year. </p>

                    <h4 class="faqQuestion">What sort of germ is <em>Campylobacter</em>?</h4>
                    <p><em>Campylobacter</em> organisms are  spiral-shaped bacteria that can cause disease in humans and animals. Most human  illness is caused by one species, called <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em>, but human  illness can also be caused by other species. <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em> grows  best at 37<sup>°</sup>C to 42<sup>°</sup>C, the approximate body temperature of a bird (41<sup>°</sup>C to  42<sup>°</sup>C), and seems to be well adapted to birds, who carry it without becoming  ill. These bacteria are fragile. They cannot tolerate drying and can be killed  by oxygen. They grow only in places with less oxygen than the amount in the  atmosphere. Freezing reduces the number of <em>Campylobacter</em> bacteria on raw  meat. </p>

                    <a id="diagnose" name="diagnose"></a>
                    <h4 class="faqQuestion">How is the infection diagnosed?</h4>
                    <p>Many different kinds of infections can cause diarrhea and bloody diarrhea. <em>Campylobacter</em> infection is diagnosed when a culture of a stool specimen yields the bacterium.</p>
                    <div class="topPage"><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></div>
                    
                    <a id="treat" name="treat"></a>
                    <h4 class="faqQuestion">How can campylobacteriosis be treated?</h4>
                    <p>Almost all persons  infected with <em>Campylobacter</em> recover without any specific treatment.  Patients should drink extra fluids as long as the diarrhea lasts. Antimicrobial  therapy is warranted only for patients with severe disease or those at high  risk for severe disease, such as those with immune systems severely weakened  from medications or other illnesses. Azithromycin and fluoroquinolones (e.g.,  ciprofloxacin) are commonly used for treatment of these infections, but  resistance to fluoroquinolones is common. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing  can help guide appropriate therapy. </p>

                    <a id="long-term" name="long-term"></a>
                    <h4 class="faqQuestion">Are there long-term consequences?</h4>
                    <p>Most people who  get campylobacteriosis recover completely within two to five days, although  sometimes recovery can take up to 10 days. Rarely, <em>Campylobacter</em> infection results in long-term consequences. Some people develop arthritis.  Others may develop a rare disease called Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome that affects  the nerves of the body beginning several weeks after the diarrheal illness.  This occurs when a person's immune system is "triggered" to attack  the body's own nerves resulting in paralysis. The paralysis usually lasts  several weeks and requires intensive medical care. It is estimated that  approximately one in every 1,000 reported <em>Campylobacter</em> illnesses leads  to Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome. As many as 40% of Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome cases in  this country may be triggered by campylobacteriosis. </p>

                    <h4 class="faqQuestion">How do people get infected with this germ?</h4>
                    <p>Campylobacteriosis  usually occurs in single, sporadic cases, but it can also occur in outbreaks,  when two or more people become ill from the same source. Most cases of  campylobacteriosis are associated with eating raw or undercooked poultry meat  or from cross-contamination of other foods by these items. Outbreaks of <em>Campylobacter</em> have most often been associated with unpasteurized dairy products, contaminated  water, poultry, and produce. Animals can also be infected, and some people get  infected from contact with the stool of an ill dog or cat. The organism is not  usually spread from one person to another, but this can happen if the infected  person is producing a large volume of diarrhea.</p>
                    <p>                      It only takes a  very few <em>Campylobacter</em> organisms (fewer than 500) to make a person sick.  Even one drop of juice from raw chicken meat can have enough <em>Campylobacter </em>in it to infect a person!  One way to become infected is to cut poultry meat on a cutting board, and then  use the unwashed cutting board or utensil to prepare vegetables or other raw or  lightly cooked foods. The <em>Campylobacter</em> organisms from the raw meat can  get onto the other foods. </p>

					<a id="food_water" name="food_water"></a>
                    <h4 class="faqQuestion">How does food or water get contaminated with <em>Campylobacter</em>?</h4>
                    <p>Many chicken  flocks are infected with <em>Campylobacter</em> but show no signs of illness. <em>Campylobacter</em> can be easily spread from bird to bird through a common water source or through  contact with infected feces. When an infected bird is slaughtered, <em>Campylobacter</em> organisms can be transferred from the intestines to the meat. In 2011, <em>Campylobacter</em> was found on 47% of raw chicken samples bought in grocery stores and tested  through the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS). <em>Campylobacter</em> can also be present in the giblets, especially the liver.</p>
                    <p>                      Unpasteurized milk  can become contaminated if the cow has an infection with <em>Campylobacter</em> in her udder or if the milk is contaminated with manure. Surface water and  mountain streams can become contaminated from infected feces from cows or wild  birds. <em>Campylobacter </em>is common in the developing world, and travelers to  foreign countries are at risk for becoming infected with <em>Campylobacter</em>.  Approximately one-fifth (19%) of <em>Campylobacter</em> cases identified in FoodNet are associated with international travel. </p>

                    <h4 class="faqQuestion">What can be done to prevent <em>Campylobacter</em> infection?</h4>
                    <p>Some simple food handling practices can help prevent <em>Campylobacter</em> infections.</p> 
					<ul>
					  <li>Cook all poultry products  thoroughly. Make sure that the meat is cooked throughout (no longer pink) and  any juices run clear. All poultry should be cooked to reach a minimum internal  temperature of 165<sup>°</sup>F. </li> 
                      <li>If you are served undercooked  poultry in a restaurant, send it back for further cooking. </li>
                      <li>Wash hands with soap before  preparing food </li>
                      <li>Wash hands with soap after handling  raw foods of animal origin and before touching anything else. </li>
                      <li>Prevent cross-contamination in the  kitchen by using separate cutting boards for foods of animal origin and other  foods and by thoroughly cleaning all cutting boards, countertops, and utensils  with soap and hot water after preparing raw food of animal origin. </li>
                      <li>Do not drink unpasteurized milk or  untreated surface water. </li>
                      <li>Make sure that persons with  diarrhea, especially children, wash their hands carefully and frequently with  soap to reduce the risk of spreading the infection. </li>
                      <li>Wash hands with soap after contact  with pet feces. </li>
                    </ul>
					<p>Physicians who diagnose campylobacteriosis and  clinical laboratories that identify this organism should report their findings  to the local health department. If many cases occur at the same time, it may  mean that an outbreak has occurred in which many people were exposed to a  common contaminated food item or water source. If this food or water is still  available, more people could get infected. Public health departments  investigate outbreaks to identify the source so that action can be taken to  prevent more cases.</p>

                    <h4 class="faqQuestion">What are public health agencies doing to prevent or control campylobacteriosis?</h4>
                    <p>To learn more  about how <em>Campylobacter</em> causes  disease and its spread, CDC began a detailed active surveillance sentinel  system, <a href="/foodnet/index.html">FoodNet</a>, in five sites in 1996 and  subsequently expanded to ten sites. FoodNet monitors the incidence and trends  of human <em>Campylobacter</em> infection (as  well as other germs transmitted commonly through food) over time and conducts  studies to identify risk factors for infection. </p>
                    <p>The U.S. Department of  Agriculture (USDA) conducts research on how to prevent <em>Campylobacter</em> infection in chickens. In 2011, USDA established  performance standards to limit <em>Campylobacter</em> contamination of whole broiler chickens in processing plants. The Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) has produced the Model Food Code for restaurants.  Adherence to it decreases the risk of <em>Campylobacter</em> infection.</p>
                    <p>The <a href="/narms/index.html">National Antimicrobial  Resistance Monitoring System</a> (NARMS), a collaboration  among CDC, FDA, USDA, and health departments, tracks changes in antibiotic  resistance among <em>Campylobacter</em> from  humans, retail meats, and food animals.</p>
                    <p> <a href="/pulsenet/">PulseNet</a> is a national  network whose participants perform standardized molecular subtyping (or  “fingerprinting”) of foodborne disease-causing bacteria by pulsed-field gel  electrophoresis (PFGE). PFGE can be used to distinguish strains of organisms  including <em>Campylobacter</em> at the DNA  level. DNA “fingerprints,” or patterns, are submitted electronically to a  dynamic database at the CDC. These databases are available on-demand to  participantsâthis allows for rapid comparison of the patterns.</p>
