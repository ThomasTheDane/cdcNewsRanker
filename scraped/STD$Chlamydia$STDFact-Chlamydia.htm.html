<a id="a1"></a><h3>What is chlamydia?</h3>
<p><a href="/std/chlamydia/default.htm">Chlamydia</a> is a common STD  that can infect both men and women. It can cause serious, permanent damage to a  woman's reproductive system, making it difficult or impossible for her to get  pregnant later on. Chlamydia can also cause a potentially fatal ectopic  pregnancy (pregnancy that occurs outside the womb).</p>

<a id="a2"></a><h3>How is chlamydia spread?</h3>
        <p>You can get chlamydia  by having anal, vaginal, or oral sex with someone who has chlamydia.</p>
        <p>If your sex partner is male you can still get chlamydia even if he does not ejaculate (cum).</p>
<p>If you’ve had chlamydia and were treated in the past, you can still get infected again if you have unprotected sex with someone who has chlamydia.</p>
        <p>If you are pregnant, <a href="/std/pregnancy/STDfact-Pregnancy.htm">you can give chlamydia to your baby during childbirth</a>.</p>

<a id="a3"></a><h3>How can I avoid getting chlamydia?</h3>
        <p>You can protect yourself from getting chlamydia by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Not having sex; </li>
          <li>Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and has negative STD test  results;</li>
          <li>Using latex condoms and dental dams the right way every time you have sex.</li>
        </ul>
<p class="topOPage" style="display:none;"><a class="mobileBackToTop" href="#">Back to Top</a></p>
<a id="a4"></a><h3>Am I at risk for chlamydia?</h3>
<p>Anyone who has sex can get chlamydia through unprotected anal, vaginal, or oral sex. However, sexually active young people are at a higher risk of getting chlamydia. This is due to behaviors and biological factors common among young people. Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men are also at risk since chlamydia can be spread through oral and anal sex.</p>
<p>Have an honest and open talk with your health care provider and ask whether  you should be tested for chlamydia or other STDs. If you are a  sexually active woman aged 25 years or younger, you should get a test for  chlamydia every year. <a href="/std/chlamydia/STDFact-Chlamydia-detailed.htm">Gay, bisexual, and men who have sex with men; as well as  pregnant women should also be tested for chlamydia</a>.</p>

<h3>I'm pregnant. How does chlamydia affect my baby?</h3>
<p>If you are  pregnant and have chlamydia, you can pass the infection to your baby during  delivery. This could cause an eye infection or pneumonia in your newborn. Having  chlamydia may also make it more likely to deliver your baby too early. </p>
<p>If you are  pregnant, you should be tested for chlamydia at your first prenatal visit.  Testing and treatment are the best ways to prevent health problems. </p>

<h3>How do I know if I have chlamydia?</h3>
        
        <p>Most people who  have chlamydia have no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they may not appear  until several weeks after you have sex with an infected partner. Even when chlamydia  causes no symptoms, it can damage your reproductive system.</p>
        
        <p><img alt="illustration of female anatomy showing fallopian tubes, ovary, cervix, uterus, and vagina" class="righty" height="295" src="../images/anatomy-female-300.gif" width="300"/>Women with  symptoms may notice</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An abnormal vaginal discharge;</li>
          <li>A burning sensation when urinating.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Symptoms in men can  include</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A discharge from their penis;</li>
          <li>A burning sensation when urinating;</li>
          <li>Pain and swelling in one or both testicles (although this is less  common).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Men and women  can also get infected with chlamydia in their rectum, either by having receptive  anal sex, or by spread from another infected site (such as the vagina). While  these infections often cause no symptoms, they can cause</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rectal pain; </li>
          <li>Discharge; </li>
          <li>Bleeding.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You should be  examined by your doctor if you notice any of these symptoms or if your partner  has an STD or symptoms of an STD, such as an unusual sore, a smelly discharge,  burning when urinating, or bleeding between periods. </p>

<a id="a7"></a><h3>How will my doctor know if I have chlamydia?</h3>
        <p>There are  laboratory tests to diagnose chlamydia. Your health care provider may ask you  to provide a urine sample or may use (or ask you to use) a cotton swab to get a  sample from your vagina to test for chlamydia. </p>
        <p class="topOPage" style="display:none;"><a class="mobileBackToTop" href="#">Back to Top</a></p>
<a id="a8"></a>
<h3>Can chlamydia be cured?</h3>
<p>Yes, chlamydia can be cured with the right treatment. It is important that you take all of the medication your doctor prescribes to cure  your infection. When taken properly it will stop the infection and could decrease your chances of having complications later on. Â Medication for chlamydia should not be shared  with anyone.</p>
<p>Repeat infection with chlamydia is common. You should be tested again about three months after you are treated, even if your sex partner(s) was treated.</p>
<p class="topOPage" style="display:none;"><a class="mobileBackToTop" href="#">Back to Top</a></p>
<a id="a9"></a><h3>I was treated for chlamydia. When can I have sex again?</h3>
<p>You should not  have sex again until you and your sex partner(s) have completed treatment. If  your doctor prescribes a single dose of medication, you should wait seven days  after taking the medicine before having sex. If your doctor prescribes a  medicine for you to take for seven days, you should wait until you have taken  all of the doses before having sex.</p>

<a id="a10"></a><h3>What happens if I don't get treated?</h3>
          <p>The initial  damage that chlamydia causes often goes unnoticed. However, chlamydia can lead  to serious health problems.</p>
          <p>If you are a woman, untreated chlamydia can spread to your uterus and fallopian tubes (tubes  that carry fertilized eggs from the ovaries to the uterus), causing <a href="/std/PID/STDFact-PID.htm">pelvic inflammatory  disease</a> (PID). PID often has no symptoms, however some women may have abdominal and  pelvic pain. Even if it doesn’t cause symptoms initially, PID can cause  permanent damage to your reproductive system and lead to long-term pelvic pain, <a href="/std/infertility/">inability to get  pregnant</a>,  and <a href="/std/pregnancy/STDFact-Pregnancy.htm">potentially  deadly ectopic pregnancy</a> (pregnancy outside the uterus).</p>
          <p>Men rarely have health  problems linked to chlamydia. Infection sometimes spreads to the tube that  carries sperm from the testicles, causing pain and fever. Rarely, chlamydia can  prevent a man from being able to have children.</p>
          <p><a href="/std/HIV/STDFact-STD-HIV.htm">Untreated chlamydia  may also increase your chances of getting or giving HIV â the virus that causes  AIDS. </a></p>
