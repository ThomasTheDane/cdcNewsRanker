It is estimated to kill more that 5 million people each year and more than 600,000 peopleâmore than a quarter of them childrenâwill die from exposure to secondhand smoke. If current trends continue, by 2030, tobacco use could cause more the 8 million deaths annually.</p><p>WHO introduced the MPOWER package to assist in country-level implementation of measures to reduce the demand for tobacco use. GTSSData users are able to search for information based on either a tobacco topic or one of the six MPOWER measures: <strong>M</strong>onitor tobacco use and prevention policies, <strong>P</strong>rotect people from tobacco smoke, <strong>O</strong>ffer help to quit, <strong>W</strong>arn of dangers, <strong>E</strong>nforce bans on advertizing/promotion/sponsorship, or <strong>R</strong>aise taxes on tobacco.</p><p>GTSS includes four tobacco-related surveys: the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS), Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS), Global School Personnel Survey (GSPS), and Global Health Professions Student Survey (GHPSS). Information is available on 20 tobacco topics from more than 120 countries.</p><p>GTSSData was designed to accommodate the needs of different types of users. Policymakers and media staff can quickly access analyzed country data reports and fact sheets and also view data for key tobacco and MPOWER topics. They can view data tables and graphs by demographics, compare data across countries, and view trends over time. Researchers can easily download complete data sets, survey instruments, and technical documentation for their own analysis.</p><h3 id="moreInfo">More Information</h3><ul><li><a href="/tobacco/global/index.htm">Global Tobacco Control</a><br/></li><li><a href="/tobacco/global/gtss/index.htm">Global Tobacco Surveillance System</a><br/></li><li><a href="http://www.who.int/tobacco/wntd/2011/announcement/en/index1.html" target="_blank">World No Tobacco Day</a></li></ul></div><!-- END mSyndicate --></div><!-- END syndicate --></div>
