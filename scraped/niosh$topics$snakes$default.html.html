															<p>Venomous snakes found in the United States include rattlesnakes, copperheads, cottonmouths/water moccasins, and coral snakes. They can be dangerous to outdoor workers including farmers, foresters, landscapers, groundskeepers, gardeners, painters, roofers, pavers, construction workers, laborers, mechanics, and any other workers who spend time outside. Although rare, some workers with a severe allergy to snake venom may be at risk of death if bitten. It has been estimated that 7,000â8,000 people per year receive venomous bites in the United States, and about 5 of those people die. The number of deaths would be much higher if people did not seek medical care. It is important for employers to train their workers about their risk of exposure to venomous snakes, how they can prevent and protect themselves from snake bites, and what they should do if they are bitten.</p><h3><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="type" name="type" title="Types of Venomous Snakes"></a>Types of Venomous Snakes</h3><p><a href="#_Rattlesnakes">Rattlesnakes</a> | <a href="#_Copperheads">Copperheads</a> | <a href="#_Cottonmouths">Cottonmouths/Water Moccasins</a> | <a href="#_Coral">Coral Snakes</a></p><h4><a id="_Rattlesnakes" name="_Rattlesnakes"></a>Rattlesnakes</h4><p>Â <img alt="rattlesnake" class="" height="130" src="/niosh/topics/snakes/images/rattlesnake1.jpg" width="195"/>Â Â Â <img alt="rattlesnake" class="" height="130" src="/niosh/topics/snakes/images/rattlesnake2.jpg" width="177"/>Â Â Â <img alt="rattlesnake" class="" height="130" src="/niosh/topics/snakes/images/rattlesnake3.jpg" width="153"/>Â <br/><span class="caption">Photos courtesy of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (1 &amp; 2) and Edward J.

They can accurately strike at up to one-third their body length. Rattlesnakes use their rattles or tails as a warning when they feel threatened. Rattlesnakes may be found sunning themselves near logs, boulders, or open areas. These snakes may be found in most work habitats including the mountains, prairies, deserts, and beaches.</p><p><strong>U.S. Geographic Region:</strong> Across the United States.</p><h4><a id="_Copperheads" name="_Copperheads"></a>Copperheads</h4><p>Â <img alt="cooperhead snake" class="" height="130" src="/niosh/topics/snakes/images/copperhead1.jpg" width="195"/>Â Â Â <img alt="cooperhead snake" class="" height="130" src="/niosh/topics/snakes/images/copperhead2.jpg" width="173"/>Â Â Â <img alt="copperhead snake" class="" height="130" src="/niosh/topics/snakes/images/copperhead3.jpg" width="159"/>Â <br/><span class="caption">Photos courtesy of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (1 &amp; 2) and Edward J. Wozniak of CDC (3)</span></p><p>Copperheads vary in color from reddish to golden tan. The colored bands on their body are typically hourglass-shaped. Most adults are 18â36 inches long. They are not usually aggressive, but will often freeze when frightened. Workers are more likely to be bitten when they unknowingly step on or near a copperhead. Copperheads are often found in forests, rocky areas, swamps, or near sources of water like rivers.</p><p><strong>U.S. Geographic Region:</strong> Eastern states, extending as far west as Texas.</p><h4><a id="_Cottonmouths" name="_Cottonmouths"></a>Cottonmouths/Water Moccasins</h4><p>Â <img alt="cottonmouth snake" class="" height="160" src="/niosh/topics/snakes/images/cottonmouth1.jpg" width="200"/>Â Â Â <img alt="cottonmouth snake" class="" height="160" src="/niosh/topics/snakes/images/cottonmouth2.jpg" width="177"/>Â Â Â <img alt="cottonmouth snake" class="" height="160" src="/niosh/topics/snakes/images/cottonmouth3.jpg" width="154"/>Â <br/><span class="caption">Photos courtesy of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (1 &amp; 2) and Edward J. Wozniak (3)</span></p><p>Cottonmouth snakes average 50â55 inches long. The adult snakeâs skin is dark tan, brown, or nearly black, with vague black or dark brown crossbands. Juveniles have a bold crossbanded pattern of brown or orange with a yellow tail. Cottonmouths are frequently found in or around water. They do not scare easily and will defend themselves when threatened.</p><p><strong>U.S. Geographic Region:</strong> Wetland areas, rivers, lakes, etc., in the southeastern states.</p><h4><a id="_Coral" name="_Coral"></a>Coral Snakes</h4><p>Â <img alt="coral snake" class="" height="110" src="/niosh/topics/snakes/images/coral1.jpg" width="371"/>Â Â Â <img alt="coral snake" class="" height="110" src="/niosh/topics/snakes/images/coral2.jpg" width="165"/>Â <br/><span class="caption">Photos courtesy of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (1) and Edward J. Wozniak (2)</span></p><p>These snakes are often confused with nonvenomous king snakes, which have similar colored bands although in a different arrangement. However, if the red bands are touching the yellow bands, then it is a venomous coral snake. Coral snakes tend to hide in leaf piles or burrow into the ground.</p><p><strong>U.S. Geographic Region:</strong> Wooded, sandy, or marshy areas of the Southern United States.</p><h3><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="symptoms" name="symptoms" title="Symptoms"></a>Symptoms</h3><p>Signs or symptoms associated with a snake bite may vary depending on the type of snake, but may include:</p><ul><li>A pair of puncture marks at the wound</li><li>Redness and swelling around the bite</li><li>Severe pain at the site of the bite</li><li>Nausea and vomiting</li><li>Labored breathing (in extreme cases, breathing may stop altogether)</li><li>Disturbed vision</li><li>Increased salivation and sweating</li><li>Numbness or tingling around your face and/or limbs</li></ul><h3><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="recomm" name="recomm" title="Recommendations for Protecting Workers"></a>Recommendations for Protecting Workers</h3><p>Employers should protect their workers from venomous snake bites by training them about:</p><ul><li>Their risk of exposure to venomous snakes</li><li>How to identify venomous snakes</li><li>How to prevent snake bites</li><li>What they should do if they are bitten by a snake</li></ul><h4>Preventing Snake Bites</h4><p>Workers should take the following steps to prevent a snake bite:</p><ul><li>Do not try to handle any snake.</li><li>Stay away from tall grass and piles of leaves when possible.</li><li>Avoid climbing on rocks or piles of wood where a snake may be hiding.</li><li>Be aware that snakes tend to be active at night and in warm weather.</li><li>Wear boots and long pants when working outdoors.</li><li>Wear leather gloves when handling brush and debris.</li></ul><h4>First Aid</h4><p>Workers should take the following steps if they are bitten by a snake:</p><ul><li>Seek medical attention as soon as possible (dial 911 or call local Emergency Medical Services.)</li><li>Try to remember the color and shape of the snake, which can help with treatment of the snake bite.</li><li>Keep still and calm.
