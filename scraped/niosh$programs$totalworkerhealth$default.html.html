Traditionally, workplace health and safety programs have been compartmentalized. Health protection programs have focused squarely on safety, reducing worker exposures to risk factors arising in the work environment itself. And most workplace health promotion programs have focused exclusively on lifestyle factors off-the-job that place workers at risk. A growing body of science supports the effectiveness of combining these efforts through workplace interventions that integrate health protection and health promotion programs.</p><p>In June 2011, NIOSH launched the Total Worker Healthâ¢ (TWHâ¢) Program as an evolution of the NIOSH Steps to a Healthier U.S. Workforce and the NIOSH WorkLife Initiatives. The TWHâ¢ Program supports the development and adoption of ground-breaking research and best practices of integrative approaches that address health risk from both the work environment (physical and organizational) and individual behavior. The original scientific rationale for expanding research on the benefits of integrated programs to improve worker health and workplace safety was published in a research compendium of three seminal papers on the science and practice of integrating health protection and health promotion, <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2012-146/">The NIOSH Total Worker Healthâ¢ Program: Seminal Research Papers 2012</a>.</p><p>The TWHâ¢ Program includes an <a href="/niosh/programs/totalworkerhealth/projects.html">intramural component</a> and an extramural component, comprised of four <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/TWH/centers.html">Centers of Excellence to Promote a Healthier Workforce</a>. Both of these components conduct research on the integration of health protection and health promotion; communication of current knowledge, successful approaches, and challenges, and advocacy of the concepts and practices of total worker health to our partners and stakeholders.</p><p>In November 2012, further evidence was presented by the four NIOSH-funded <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/TWH/centers.html">Centers of Excellence to Promote a Healthier Workforce</a> at the first Symposium on Total Worker Healthâ¢ sponsored by <a href="http://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/hwce/twhsymposium/index.html">the University of Iowa's Healthier Workforce Center of Excellence</a>.</p><p>The "Issues Relevant to Total Worker Healthâ¢" graphic below is an at-a-glance visual of issues relevant to integrating occupational safety and health protection with health promotion. The lists below are not meant to be exhaustive, but, rather they illustrate the breadth of issues related to work that has the potential to impact health and should be considered as strategies are developed for the integration of health protection and health promotion activities.</p><div class="module noBorder bulleted-links" id="testelement"><div class="inner"><h2 style=" text-align: center;">Issues Relevant to a Total Worker Healthâ¢ Perspective*</h2><div class="threeColumn"><div class="c33l"><div class="subcr"><div class="module rounders bulleted-links"><div class="inner" id="col_1"><div class="t" id="col_1t"></div><h3 style=" text-align: center;">WORKPLACE</h3><h5 style=" text-align: center;"><em>Protecting Worker Safety &amp;
