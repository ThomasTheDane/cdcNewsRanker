Alzheimerâs disease involves parts of the brain that control thought, memory, and language and can seriously affect a personâs ability to carry out daily activities. Although scientists are learning more every day, right now, they still do not know what causes Alzheimerâs disease.</p><h2><img alt="A man and a woman standing.

While younger people may get Alzheimerâs disease, it is much less common. The disease usually begins after age 60, and risk goes up with age. About 5 percent of men and women ages 65 to 74 have Alzheimerâs disease, and nearly half of those age 85 and older may have the disease. It is important to note, however, that Alzheimerâs disease is not a normal part of aging.</p><div id="imageleft"></div><h2>What causes Alzheimerâs Disease?</h2><p><img alt="A middle-aged man and woman sitting.

There probably is not one single cause, but several factors that affect each person differently. Age is the most important known risk factor for Alzheimerâs disease. The number of people with the disease doubles every 5 years beyond age 65.</p><p>Family history is another risk factor. Researchers believe that genetics may play a role in developing Alzheimerâs disease.</p><p>Scientists still need to learn a lot more about what causes Alzheimerâs disease. In addition to genetics, they are studying education, diet, and environment to learn what role they might play in developing this disease. Scientists are finding more and more evidence that some of the risk factors for heart disease and stroke, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and low levels of the vitamin folate may also increase the risk of Alzheimerâs disease. Evidence for physical, mental and social activities as protective factors against Alzheimerâs disease is also growing.</p><div id="imageright"></div><h2>What is the burden of Alzheimerâs disease in the United States?<img alt="An older man and woman standing in front of a house. Both are smiling into the camera. The man is standing behind the woman with his hands on her shoulders." height="133" src="/aging/images/alz3.jpg" style=" padding-bottom: 5px; border: 0; padding-left: 5px; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 5px; float: right;" width="200"/></h2><p>Alzheimerâs disease is one of the top ten leading causes of death in the United States. Alzheimerâs disease is the 6th leading cause of death among American adults, and the 5th leading cause of death for adults aged 65 years and older.<sup>1</sup> Notably, mortality rates for Alzheimerâs disease are on the rise, unlike heart disease and cancer death rates which are continuing to decline.</p><p>An estimated 5.4 million Americans have Alzheimerâs disease.<sup>2</sup> This number has doubled since 1980, and is expected to be as high as 16 million by 2050<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>In 2011, total Medicare and Medicaid spending for individuals with Alzheimerâs disease is estimated at $130 billion.<sup>4</sup></p><p>The average per person Medicare payments for those with Alzheimerâs and other dementias are three times higher than for those without these conditions. Medicaid spending for older adults with Alzheimerâs disease and other dementias is nine times higher.<sup>5</sup></p><h2>References</h2><ol><li>MiniÃ±o, A; Xu, J; Kochanek, KD. âDeaths: Preliminary Data for 2008.â National Vital Statistics Reports.
