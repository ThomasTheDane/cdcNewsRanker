They usually cause colds. However, a novel coronavirus called âMiddle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirusâ (MERS-CoV) has caused severe illness and death in people from several countries. Learn more about MERS-CoV.</p></div><p>Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), formerly called "novel coronavirus (nCoV)," was identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Most people who got infected with MERS-CoV developed severe acute respiratory illness with symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. About half of them died. A small number of the reported cases had a mild respiratory illness. Investigators are trying to figure out the source of MERS-CoV and how it spreads. There are no reported cases in the United States.</p><!-- MODULE --><div class="module double-rule bulleted-links c50r" style=" margin-left: 10px;"><div class="inner"><h3>Countries With Lab-Confirmed MERS Cases</h3>

It is also different from the coronavirus that caused <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/sars">SARS</a> (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in 2003. However, like the SARS virus, MERS-CoV is most similar to coronaviruses found in bats.</p><h3>What Are Coronaviruses?</h3><p>Coronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes on their surface. They are common viruses that most people get in their lifetime. These viruses usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses.</p><p>Coronaviruses may also infect animals. Most of these coronaviruses usually infect only one animal species or, at most, a small number of closely related species. However, SARS coronavirus can infect people and animals, including monkeys, Himalayan palm civets, raccoon dogs, cats, dogs, and rodents.</p><h3>Global Partners Working to Understand MERS</h3><!-- <p>The World Health Organization (WHO), CDC, and other partners are learning more about MERS. They are working to better understand the possible risks to the public's health.
