Below is a summary of the key indicators for the week ending March 22, 2014 (week 12):</p><ul type="circle"><li>For the week ending March 22, the national proportion of people seeing their <a href="/flu/weekly/index.htm#OISmap" target="_blank">health care provider</a> for influenza-like illness (ILI) decreased and remains below the national baseline of 2.0% for the second week. ILI was above or at baseline for 15 weeks this season. Four of 10 regions continue to report ILI activity at or above their region-specific baseline levels. Additional information regarding regional activity is available through <a href="http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html" target="_blank">FluView Interactive</a>.</li><li>No states experienced high ILI activity. One state (Texas) and New York City experienced moderate <a href="/flu/weekly/index.htm#P1" target="_blank">ILI activity</a>. Two states (Minnesota and Utah) experienced low ILI activity. Forty-seven states experienced minimal ILI activity. The District of Columbia did not have sufficient data to calculate an activity level. ILI activity data indicate the amount of flu-like illness that is occurring in each state.</li><li>Four states reported widespread <a href="/flu/weekly/index.htm#S5" target="_blank">geographic influenza activity</a>. The same number of states reported widespread activity during the previous week. Guam and seven states reported regional activity. Washington, D.C. and 17 states reported local activity. Puerto Rico and 22 states reported sporadic influenza activity. The U.S. Virgin Islands reported no influenza activity. Geographic spread data show how many areas within a state or territory are seeing flu activity.</li><li>8,405 laboratory-confirmed <a href="/flu/weekly/index.htm#HS" target="_blank">influenza-associated hospitalizations</a> have been reported since October 1, 2013. This translates to a cumulative overall rate of 31.1 hospitalizations per 100,000 people in the United States. The cumulative hospitalization rate for the same week last season (week 12) was 41.9 per 100,000. More data on hospitalization rates are available through <a href="http://gis.cdc.gov/GRASP/Fluview/FluHospRates.html" target="_blank">FluView Interactive</a>. <ul type="square"><li>The highest hospitalization rates are among people 65 and older (70.3 per 100,000), followed by people 50-64 years (48.8 per 100,000) and children younger than 5 years (42.7 per 100,000). During most seasons, children younger than 5 years and adults 65 years and older have the highest hospitalization rates.</li><li>Of the 8,405 influenza-associated hospitalizations that have been reported this season, more than 60% have been in people 18 to 64 years old. This trend of increased hospitalizations among younger people was also seen during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.</li><li><a href="/flu/weekly/overview.htm#Hospitalization" target="_blank">Hospitalization data</a> are collected from 13 states and represent approximately 8.5% of the total U.S. population. The number of hospitalizations reported does not reflect the actual total number of influenza-associated hospitalizations in the United States.</li></ul></li><li>The <a href="/flu/weekly/index.htm#MS" target="_blank">proportion of deaths</a> attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&amp;I) based on the 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System increased slightly to 7.2% but remains below the epidemic threshold.</li><li>Four <a href="/flu/weekly/index.htm#MS2" target="_blank">influenza-associated pediatric deaths</a> were reported to CDC during the week of March 16-22 (week 12). One death was associated with a 2009 H1N1 virus, two deaths were associated with an influenza A virus for which no subtyping was performed, and one death was associated with an influenza B virus. A total of 79 influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported for the 2013-2014 season at this time. Additional information about the pediatric deaths from this season and previous seasons is available through <a href="/flu/weekly/fluviewinteractive.htm" target="_blank">FluView Interactive</a>.</li><li>Nationally, the percentage of <a href="/flu/weekly/index.htm#S1" target="_blank">respiratory specimens</a> testing positive for influenza viruses in the United States during the week ending March 22, 2014 increased slightly to 11.5%. Averaged over the last three weeks, the regional percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza viruses ranged from 4.5% to 22.1%.</li><li><a href="/flu/weekly/index.htm#whomap" target="_blank">Influenza A (H3N2), 2009 H1N1, and influenza B viruses</a> have all been identified in the U.S. this season. To date, 2009 H1N1 viruses have predominated. This is the H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009 to cause a pandemic. 2009 H1N1 viruses have continued to circulate among people since that time, but this is the first season that the virus has circulated at such high levels since the pandemic. During the week ending March 22, 348 (61%) of the 571 influenza-positive tests reported to CDC were influenza A viruses and 223 (39%) were influenza B viruses. Of the 169 influenza A viruses that were subtyped, 40% were H3 viruses and 60% were 2009 H1N1 viruses.</li><li>CDC has antigenically characterized 1,914 influenza viruses; 1,562 2009 H1N1 viruses, 229 influenza A (H3N2) viruses, and 123 influenza B viruses, collected since October 1, 2013. <ul type="square"><li>1,561 (99.9%) of the 1,562 2009 H1N1 viruses tested were characterized as A/California/7/2009-like. This is the influenza A (H1N1) component of the Northern Hemisphere quadrivalent and trivalent vaccines for the 2013-2014 season.</li><li>224 (97.8%) of the 229 influenza A (H3N2) viruses tested were characterized as Texas/50/2012-like. This is the influenza A (H3N2) component of the Northern Hemisphere quadrivalent and trivalent vaccines for the 2013-2014 season.</li><li>84 (68%) of the 123 influenza B viruses tested belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage of viruses, and were characterized as B/Massachusetts/02/2012-like. This is an influenza B component for the 2013-2014 Northern Hemisphere quadrivalent and trivalent influenza vaccines.</li><li>The 39 (32%) other influenza B viruses belonged to the B/Victoria lineage of viruses, and were characterized as B/Brisbane/60/2008-like. This is the recommended influenza B component of the 2013-2014 Northern Hemisphere quadrivalent influenza vaccine.</li></ul></li><li>Since October 1, 2013, CDC has tested 4,624 2009 H1N1, 334 influenza A (H3N2), and 200 influenza B virus samples for <a href="/flu/weekly/index.htm#S9" target="_blank">resistance</a> to the neuraminidase inhibitor influenza antiviral drugs. While the vast majority of the 2009 H1N1 viruses that have been tested are sensitive to oseltamivir and zanamivir, eleven additional 2009 H1N1 virus showed resistance to oseltamivir and were reported during the week ending March 22. So far this season 54 (1%) 2009 H1N1 viruses have shown resistance to oseltamivir. No influenza A (H3N2) or influenza B viruses have shown resistance to oseltamivir.Â  No viruses have shown resistance to zanamivir. <ul type="square"><li>The neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir are currently the only recommended influenza <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/antivirals/index.htm" target="_blank">antiviral drugs</a>.</li><li>As in recent past seasons, high levels of resistance to the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) continue to persist among 2009 H1N1 and influenza A (H3N2) viruses. Adamantanes are not effective against influenza B viruses. Adamantanes are not recommended for use against influenza this season.</li></ul></li></ul><p><a href="/flu/weekly/fluactivitysurv.htm" target="_blank">FluView</a> is available â and past issues are <a href="/flu/weekly/pastreports.htm" target="_blank">archived</a> â on the CDC website.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Delays in reporting may mean that data changes over time.
