<h2><a name="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2>
<p><b>Introduction</b><br/>
Diabetes-related health improvements achieved from self-management education 
interventions are not sustained long-term. We examined the health effects at 1 
year follow-up of a 2-year, empowerment-based, diabetes self-management support 
intervention designed for African Americans.</p>
<p><b>Methods</b><br/>
We collected data from 52 African American adults with type 2 diabetes who 
completed the 3-year study. The intervention consisted of weekly groups led by 2 
health care professionals and emphasized experiential learning, emotional 
coping, problem solving, goal setting, and action planning; group discussion was 
guided by participant-identified self-management priorities and concerns. 
Measurements were taken at baseline, 24 months (postintervention), and 36 months 
(1 year follow-up) to assess glycemic control; weight; body mass index; serum 
cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol levels; systolic and diastolic blood pressure; self-care behaviors; 
diabetes-specific quality of life; and diabetes empowerment.</p>
<p><b>Results</b><br/>
Following the 2-year diabetes self-management support intervention, we found 
significant improvements for following a healthy diet (<i>P</i> = .03), spacing 
carbohydrates evenly across the day (<i>P</i> = .005), using insulin as 
recommended (<i>P</i> = .047), and achieving diabetes-specific quality of life (<i>P</i> 
= .02). At 1-year follow-up, not only did participants sustain the behavioral 
improvements made in the 2-year diabetes self-management support intervention, 
but they also demonstrated additional improvements in glycemic control (<i>P</i> 
&lt; .001) and in serum cholesterol (<i>P</i> &lt; .001) and low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol levels (<i>P</i> = .001).</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b><br/>
Participation in an empowerment-based diabetes self-management support 
intervention may have a positive and enduring effect on self-care behaviors and 
on metabolic and cardiovascular health.</p>

<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Although considerable evidence supports the efficacy of diabetes 
self-management interventions in improving clinical, behavioral, and 
psychosocial outcomes (1-8), a 2001 systematic review conducted by Norris and 
colleagues (1) concluded that improvements achieved from self-management 
programs were short-lived, lasting no more than 6 months postintervention. 
However, of the 54 studies that examined glycemic control as an end point in 
this review, only 33% (n = 18) included a follow-up assessment at 12 months or 
longer, which means that most studies did not evaluate long-term outcomes. Since 
that review was published, a small but growing number of studies have 
investigated the long-term effects of self-management interventions (9-15).</p>
<p>The need to place more emphasis on lifelong self-management efforts has been 
reinforced by the National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education 
(DSME), which require that patients receive ongoing diabetes self-management 
support (DSMS) (16). Although the importance of ongoing DSMS is formally 
recognized, how much or what type of support is needed is unclear. Research 
examining long-term outcomes has used different models for supporting and 
sustaining self-management efforts including clinic-based group visits (9-11); 
intensive, structured hospital-based education (12); the chronic care model 
(13); Internet-based approaches (14); and combined education and 
skills-development training (15). Studies provide preliminary evidence that both 
simple and complex diabetes self-management interventions have the potential to 
yield enduring diabetes-related health benefits. Short-term improvements in 
glycemic control and quality of life achieved among African American women (N = 
109) with type 2 diabetes following an 11-week coping skills and a 10-week 
conventional diabetes education intervention were sustained at 24 months (15). 
Similarly, health-related improvements (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c], blood pressure, 
blood glucose monitoring) achieved from a 12-month diabetes intervention based 
on a chronic care model, compared with a usual care condition, persisted at 
3-year follow-up (13).</p>
<p>As a strategy to foster long-lasting improvements, some interventions have 
built-in periodic reinforcement strategies during the follow-up period 
(9-12,14). In a study that compared group-based self-management support with 
individual self-management, quality of life improved for participants in the 
group-based self-management intervention, which repeated its 4-session 
curriculum (ie, provided reinforcement) each year for 5 years following the 
year-long intervention, while it deteriorated for participants in the individual 
self-management support control group. Furthermore, glycemic control remained 
steady for the intervention group but worsened for the control group (11). 
Findings suggest that self-management interventions incorporating reinforcement 
can help sustain improvements made in the short term as well as promote 
continuing improvement over a longer period.</p>
<p>Support is growing for the efficacy of DSME interventions in producing 
lasting diabetes-related health benefits. Existing literature has focused on 
assessing the long-term follow-up of short-term DSME interventions. To date, 
less attention has been paid to investigating the enduring effects of long-term 
DSMS interventions. The objective of this study was to examine the effect on 
clinical, self-care, and psychosocial outcomes of a 2-year empowerment-based 
DSMS intervention at 1-year follow-up.</p>
<p class="topOPage"><a href="#">Top of Page</a></p>
<h2><a name="Methods"></a>Methods</h2>
<p>The University of Michigan institutional review board approved this study; 
methods have been described elsewhere (17,18). This investigation was part of a 
larger, single cohort, longitudinal, prospective study that was conducted in 3 
phases. Phase 1 involved a 6-month mailed DSME intervention with clinical 
feedback. Phase 2 involved a 2-year ongoing DSMS intervention called the 
Lifelong Diabetes Self-Management Intervention (LMI). Phase 3 involved a 
post-DSMS intervention follow-up period in which participants received usual 
care and no intervention. This article focuses specifically on phases 2 and 3 of 
the larger study.</p>
<h3 class="h3">The Lifelong Diabetes Self-Management Intervention</h3>
<p>The LMI was designed on the basis of patient empowerment principles, which 
view diabetes as a patient-managed disease, emphasize the patient (vs provider) 
as the ultimate decision maker, and recognize that patient-selected (vs 
provider-selected) goals have a greater likelihood of being achieved and 
sustained (19). The intervention consisted of 88 weekly sessions, each lasting 
approximately 75 minutes, conducted over 24 months. We offered sessions at a 
local community center and at different times (10:00 AM and 3:00 PM) to 
accommodate participantsâ schedules. We invited participants to attend sessions 
as frequently as they needed or were able, given their different support needs 
and competing life demands. Participantsâ self-management questions and concerns 
guided group discussions. During each group session, facilitators encouraged 
participants to share self-management challenges, discuss emotions associated 
with those challenges, participate in group-based problem solving, raise 
questions about diabetes and its care, and set self-management goals and develop 
action plans to accomplish those goals. Sessions were conducted by a nurse 
certified diabetes educator and a clinical psychologist.</p>
<p>A detailed description of participant recruitment is published elsewhere 
(17). Briefly, we recruited African American adults with type 2 diabetes living 
in the greater Ypsilanti, Michigan, area, using various approaches (eg, flyers 
posted at local health and community centers, newspaper advertisements, invited 
presentations at local African American churches). People interested in 
participating called a free study hotline to be screened for eligibility. 
Criteria for inclusion were self-identifying as African American, being aged 40 
or older, being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for at least 1 year, having 
received some form of DSME in the past, and being under the care of a health 
care provider. Eligible people enrolled in the study and provided informed 
consent.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Data collection</h3>
<p>Baseline assessment was completed immediately before conducting the LMI (at 
the end of phase 1). We also conducted assessments at 24 months (at the end of 
phase 2) and at 36 months (at the end of phase 3). All assessments included a 
blood draw (HbA1c and lipid panel), weight and height measurement, blood 
pressure reading, and a self-report survey. To compensate participants for time 
and effort, we provided a $50 stipend on completion of each assessment.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Measures</h3>
<p>We measured clinical outcomes at face-to-face, group-based assessment 
sessions. We obtained HbA1c and a lipid panel (serum, high-density lipoprotein 
[HDL], and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol) via venous puncture; 
measured systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) using 
an appropriately sized automatic blood pressure cuff (Omron HEM780, Omron 
Healthcare Inc, Lake Forest, Illinois); and measured weight using the Health o 
meter Pro Series Spring scale (Jarden Consumer Solutions, Boca Raton, Florida) 
and height using a Seca 214 stadiometer (Seca gmbh and Co, Hanover, Maryland). 
We used weight and height measurements to calculate body mass index (BMI, in 
kg/m<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p>The <i>Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities Measure, Revised</i> was used 
to assess self-management behaviors (20). We selected items including frequency 
(ie, during the past week; range, 0-7 days) of following a healthy diet; spacing 
consumption of carbohydrates evenly during the day; participating in physical 
activity; monitoring blood glucose levels; inspecting feet; and taking 
medication or insulin or both. Greater number of days was indicative of better 
self-management.</p>
<p>The Diabetes Distress Scale, a 17-item instrument that measures emotional 
distress and functioning as it relates to living with diabetes, was used to 
assess diabetes-specific quality of life (21). Responses are scored on a 6-point 
Likert scale (1 = no problem to 6 = serious problem). Score range for the 
Diabetes Distress Scale is 17 to 102; lower scores indicate a higher 
diabetes-specific quality of life.</p>
<p>Diabetes empowerment was assessed using the short form of the Diabetes 
Empowerment Scale, an 8-item scale assessing perceived ability to manage the 
psychological and social demands and challenges associated with diabetes (22). 
Items were scored on a 5-point Likert scale; higher mean scores indicate greater 
level of confidence managing oneâs diabetes.</p>
<p>Demographic characteristics included age, sex, employment status, marital 
status, education level, annual household income, insurance coverage, years 
since diagnosis, and type of diabetes treatment.</p>
<p>At the start of the intervention, we recruited 77 participants, of which 52 
(67%) were retained at the end of the 36-month study. The actual attrition rate 
(33%) was below the expected rate of 48% over the course of the 3-year study 
(20% per study year).</p>
<h3 class="h3">Statistical analysis</h3>
<p>We used descriptive statistics to assess attendance patterns and the 
demographic and diabetes careârelated characteristics of the sample. We 
conducted independent sample <i>t</i> tests and Pearson Ï<sup>2</sup> or 
Fisherâs exact test (the latter for 2 Ã 2 distributions) to compare the 
demographic and clinical characteristics of participants who completed the study 
(âparticipantsâ) and participants who dropped out of the study before completion 
(âdropoutsâ). We performed paired <i>t</i> tests to examine preâpost changes 
associated with the 2-year LMI and 1-year follow-up periods. Finally, we used 
Pearson correlations to examine the relationship between frequency of attendance 
and health-related improvements associated with the 2-year intervention.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Characteristics of the sample</h3>
<p>Mean age of participants (N = 52) was 63.1 years (standard deviation, 10.3 y; 
range, 40-84 y); 73% of participants were female and 46% were currently married 
(<a name="table1_up"></a><a href="#table1_down">Table 1</a>). Thirty-three 
percent had a high school degree or less, 75% were not currently employed, and 
52% had Medicare. No significant differences were found for either clinical or 
demographic variables between participants who completed the 3-year study and 
participants who dropped out (Table 1).</p>
<h3 class="h3">Attendance patterns</h3>
<p>Of total participants, 58% (n = 30) attended 3 to 23 sessions, 21% attended 
24 to 44 sessions, and 21% attended 45 to 83 sessions. Mean attendance for 
morning sessions was 11; mean attendance for afternoon sessions was 4. On 
average, 29% of the total sample attended each week.</p>

.001). DBP was significantly higher (<i>P</i> = .03) and HDL cholesterol was 
significantly lower (<i>P</i> = .002). No significant changes were found for 
weight, BMI, or SBP. No changes were found for self-care behavior,

<p class="topOPage"><a href="#">Top of Page</a></p>
<h2><a name="Discussion"></a>Discussion</h2>
<p>One year following an empowerment-based DSMS intervention designed for 
African Americans, participants sustained the postintervention self-care and 
quality-of-life improvements and demonstrated further improvements in metabolic 
and cardiovascular outcomes. Most notable among our findings was the significant 
improvement in glycemic control associated with the 1-year follow-up period 
(8.0% vs 7.1%). This â0.93% change in HbA1c is comparable to that achieved from 
oral agents (23). Consistent with our results, other studies have found 
significant reductions in glycemic control to emerge at long-term follow-up (18 
months and beyond) rather than immediately postintervention (9,24,25). For 
example, in a study of a diabetes education group visit intervention, HbA1c was 
significantly lower at 2-year follow-up but not at 1-year postintervention (9). 
Findings from these studies provide some support for a delayed intervention 
effect.</p>
<p>That clinical outcomes such as glycemic and lipid control would improve 
1-year following intervention withdrawal rather than immediately following the 
2-year DSMS intervention is curious. There was no significant change in the 
percentage of participants who were using insulin and taking cholesterol 
medication during this time. Although these improvements may be attributed to 
treatment intensification, it is unlikely that this level of intensification 
occurred only during the final year of the study. Another viable explanation 
could be that improvements in lifestyle and behavioral changes achieved in the 
2-year DSMS intervention (eg, making good dietary choices, spacing out 
carbohydrates, using insulin as prescribed) require more time to produce 
clinical benefits. However, after further statistical examination, we found no 
relationship between these behavioral and clinical improvements. Future studies 
should investigate other factors that could contribute to a delayed intervention 
effect.</p>
<p>Although DBP (74.8 mm Hg vs 78.7 mm Hg) and HDL cholesterol (49.9 mg/dL vs 
43.4 mg/dL) appeared to worsen at 1-year follow-up, a mean DBP of 78.7 mm Hg 
still falls within the recommended target range of at or below 80 mm Hg. 
Similarly, with regard to cardiovascular disease risk, the ratio of total 
cholesterol to HDL cholesterol is more clinically meaningful than HDL 
cholesterol alone. At 1-year follow-up, the mean ratio of total cholesterol to 
HDL cholesterol was 3.14, which is within the target range (â¤4).</p>
<p>Some studies evaluating DSME interventions have incorporated reinforcement 
during or immediately following the intervention with the objective of promoting 
continued health improvements. Although some research has found reinforcement to 
be a critical component for sustained behavior change (12), other research has 
not produced compelling evidence for its value (14). An example favoring 
reinforcement is a 4-year study of an intensive, structured hospital-based 
diabetes education program with a built-in yearly âboosterâ education session 
conducted in a group-based setting, where previous self-management topics were 
discussed and âup-to-dateâ diabetes care information was presented; in this 
study, more health-related improvements were evidenced in the intervention group 
compared with the control group (12). Alternatively, another study used a 
reinforcement component for a 6-week Internet-based diabetes self-management 
intervention via a discussion board (over 18 months) where participants could 
post messages asynchronously, with the goal of fostering reciprocal peer 
support; in this study, there were almost no intervention-control differences 
(14). Perhaps the critical question is not whether a reinforcement mechanism is 
present or absent but rather what type of reinforcement mechanism is employed 
and how frequently and how long the reinforcement mechanism is used.</p>
<p>Rather than incorporating a reinforcement component into a larger DSME 
intervention, our DSMS intervention could be conceptualized as a 
participant-driven reinforcement program in and of itself. Specifically, we 
invited participants to access support (ie, weekly sessions) as frequently as 
they needed or as was feasible, given their schedule and life circumstances. In 
other words, participants had complete control over the frequency and extent of 
support they sought. Essentially, participants functioned as active agents of 
their self-management and lifestyle change, and the weekly DSMS sessions served 
as a resource they could use in their self-management efforts. Considering this 
interpretation, participants may not have been adversely affected when the 
intervention was withdrawn. Instead, they were already directing their own 
self-management practices and decisions and could continue to do so even when 
the resource was no longer available. Clearly, a goal of DSMS interventions is 
to foster this type of self-sufficiency and self-efficacy.</p>
<p>Although our attrition rate fell within the expected range, having 33% of 
participants drop out of the study was not ideal, and we did not follow up with 
participants regarding reasons for study discontinuation. Subsequent 
investigations should include a formal protocol to inquire about dropout. This 
study had other limitations. Because of restricted funding, we were not able to 
conduct a randomized controlled trial. Without a rigorous methodological design, 
making definitive conclusions about the efficacy of this intervention was not 
possible. However, considering the extended length of the intervention and 
subsequent follow-up period, it is unlikely that improvements could be 
attributed to factors such as the initial enthusiasm at the start of a study or 
the attention one receives simply by enrolling in a study. Similarly, any 
changes associated with secular trends would have more likely reflected health 
deterioration rather than health improvement, particularly for this sample of 
older participants. Regardless, future investigations should use a randomized 
controlled trial or comparative effectiveness design to answer these questions.</p>
<p>Effective diabetes self-management requires initial DSME followed by ongoing 
DSMS (16). Given the overwhelming evidence for the short-term effect of diabetes 
self-management interventions, greater attention is needed for developing, 
implementing, and evaluating interventions that yield positive outcomes that are 
sustained throughout life. Interest in examining peer support models as an 
effective and viable approach to long-term DSMS is growing, and understanding 
which aspects or underlying mechanisms of self-management interventions lead to 
long-lasting diabetes-related health benefits is needed.</p>
