						<h1>Preventing Ticks on Your Pets</h1>
	<p>Dogs are  very susceptible to tick bites and tickborne diseases. Vaccines are not  available for all the tickborne diseases that dogs can get, and they don’t keep  the dogs from bringing ticks into your home. For these reasons, it’s important  to use a tick preventive product on your dog.</p>
<p>Tick  bites on dogs may be hard to detect. Signs of tickborne disease may not appear  for 7-21 days or longer after a tick bite, so watch your dog closely for  changes in behavior or appetite if you suspect that your pet has been bitten by  a tick.</p>
<p>To reduce  the chances that a tick will transmit disease to you or your pets:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Check your pets for ticks daily, especially after they spend time  outdoors. </li>
  <li>If you find a tick on your dog, remove it right away. </li>
  <li>Ask your veterinarian to conduct a tick check at each exam. </li>
  <li>Talk to your veterinarian about tickborne diseases in your area. </li>
  <li>Reduce tick habitat in your yard. </li>
  <li>Talk with your veterinarian about using tick preventives on your pet.  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Note: Cats are extremely sensitive to a variety of chemicals. Do not apply any insect acaricides or repellents to your cats without first consulting your veterinarian! </strong></p>
    <h2>Kill Ticks on Dogs</h2>
        <p>A  pesticide product that kills ticks is known as an acaricide.  Acaricides that can be used on dogs include dusts, impregnated collars, sprays,  or topical treatments. Some acaricides kill the tick on contact. Others may be  absorbed into the bloodstream of a dog and kill ticks that attach and feed.</p>
<h3>Pros:</h3>
             <ul>
        	    <li>Helps to reduce the number of ticks in the environment </li>
                <li>Prevents tickborne disease </li>
            </ul>
<h3>Cons:</h3>
       
              <ul>
                <li>Tick bites can cause a painful wound and may become infected. </li>
                <li>When bitten, a dog may become infected with a number of diseases.  This depends on the type of tick, which diseases it is carrying (if any), and  how quickly a product kills the feeding tick. </li>
            </ul>
