Take some simple precautions and be prepared to keep your skin safe and healthy.</p><h2>Apply Sunscreen</h2><p>For many people, summertime means spending more time outside. Since ultraviolet radiation (UV) from the sun tends to be stronger during the summer months, and exposure to UV rays appears to the most important environmental factor in developing skin cancer, itâs important to know how to best protect your skin. Sunscreen is one of many sun protective practices to prevent sunburns, a risk factor in developing skin cancer, especially the most deadly of skin cancers, melanoma. Use sunscreen with a sun protective factor (SPF) of 15 or higher and put it on your skin a half hour before you go outside so it has a chance to soak in. Also remember to reapply sunscreen after swimming or toweling.</p><p>The SPF of a sunscreen protects against one type of harmful UV rays (UV-B rays). There are currently no ratings for the other harmful UV rays (UVA rays), but you may want to check and see if your sunscreen has coverage against UVA rays.</p><p>Spending time in the sun? Know the facts:</p><p><img alt="A woman wearaing a hat" class="righty" height="294" src="/features/safeskin/safeskin_a200px.jpg" width="200"/></p><ul><li>UV rays are strongest between the hours of 10 am and 4 pm.</li><li>Reflective surfaces (water, cement, and sand) increase your chances of getting burned by the sunâs rays.</li><li>You are just as likely to get too much sun on a cloudy or hazy day as you are on a sunny one. UV rays are strong enough to burn your skin even on cloudy days.</li></ul><p><a href="/cancer/skin/basic_info/howto.htm">Sun safety tips</a>:</p><ul><li>Cover up with clothing to protect exposed skin. A long-sleeved shirt and long pants with a tight weave are best.</li><li>Wear a wide brimmed hat and wrap around sunglasses that block both UVA and UVB rays.</li><li>Seek shade, especially during the midday hours of 10:00 a.m. â 4:00 p.m. when UV rays are strongest.</li><li>In addition to sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or higher, apply lip balm with an SPF factor.</li><li>Avoid tanning salons.</li></ul><h2>Use Bug Repellent</h2><p>The best defense against mosquito and tick bites is <a href="/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/mosquitorepellent.htm">applying insect repellent</a> containing an EPA-registered active ingredient (DEET or Picaridin). Follow the directions on the package and reapply to your skin and clothing as directed.</p><p>Want to keep the bugs away? Bite prevention facts and tips:</p><ul><li><a href="/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/wnv_factsheet.htm">West Nile virus</a> (WNV), a blood-borne virus that increases in risk during the summer and fall, is typically spread by a bite from an infected mosquito.</li><li>Mosquitoes are most active at dusk and dawn. Plan indoor activities during peak mosquito hours or wear long sleeves and pants while outside.</li><li>Ticks are often found in long grass. Best to wear long pants and tuck the ends into your socks.</li><li>When youâre outside with a pet, be sure to check both you and your animal for ticks before you go inside. (See <a href="/ncidod/dvbid/lyme/ld_tickremoval.htm">instructions on removing ticks</a>.)</li></ul><h2>Keep Skin Clean</h2><p><img alt="A father putting a bandages on his son's knee." class="righty" height="285" src="/features/safeskin/safeskin_b200px.jpg" width="200"/></p><p>Wash your face with soap or mild cleanser and water in the morning, evening, and after exercising. Clean skin means there is less chance of <a href="http://www.bam.gov/sub_yourbody/yourbody_bodysmartz_microscope.html">clogged pores that lead to acne</a> â not only in the summer months, but year round. Frequent hand washing with soap and water will decrease your odds of catching â or spreading â a summertime cold or infection.</p><p>If you get a cut or scratch while outside, be sure to <a href="http://www.bt.cdc.gov/disasters/earthquakes/supplies.asp">properly clean</a> and dress the wound with water and soap to remove dirt, keep germs away, and promote the healing process. Bacteria that produce tetanus toxin and may cause <a href="/vaccines/vpd-vac/tetanus/in-short-both.htm">tetanus disease</a> (lockjaw) are found in contaminated areas such as dirt or soil, on metal, and in animal intestines. If barefoot inside or outside, be sure to watch your step.</p><p>Clean skin facts and tips:</p><ul><li>Rinse off your body after swimming to remove salt or chemicals.</li><li>Tetanus enters the body through a break in the skin, so avoid infection: keep wounds clean and bandaged.</li><li><a href="/vaccines/vpd-vac/tetanus">Tetanus vaccine</a> is available and requires a booster approximately every 10 years. Ask your physician if youâre due for a booster.</li></ul><p>Use bug repellent, wear sunscreen, and keep your skin clean. These skin care tips will help you stay healthy over the summer months and promote a safe and enjoyable season.</p><h3 id="moreInfo">More Information</h3><ul><li><a href="http://www.bam.gov/sub_diseases/5710_tetanus.html">BAM!
