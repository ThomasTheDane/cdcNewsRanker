															<p>Educators and staff can help slow the spread of colds and flu. On this page, you will find information on preventing the flu as well as materials and tools for schools.</p><p>Each year, an average of 20,000 children under the age of 5 are hospitalized because of flu-related complications. Influenza causes more hospitalizations among young children than any other vaccine-preventable disease. The single best way to protect against seasonal flu and its potential severe complications is for children to get a seasonal influenza vaccine each year. Flu vaccination is recommended for all children aged 6 months and older. Making healthy choices at school and at home can help prevent the flu and spreading flu to others.</p><p>Encourage children, parents, and staff to take the following <a href="/flu/pdf/freeresources/updated/everyday_preventive.pdf">everyday preventive actions [2 MB, 2 pages]</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Stay home when you are sick.</strong> If possible, stay home from work, school, and errands when you are sick. You will help prevent others from catching your illness. Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li><li><strong>Cover your nose and mouth</strong> with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue away after use and wash your hands. If a tissue is not available, cover your mouth and nose with your sleeve, not your hand.</li><li><strong>Wash your hands often with soap and water</strong>, especially after you cough or sneeze. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub.</li><li><strong>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth</strong>. Germs spread this way.</li><li><strong>Clean and disinfect surfaces or objects.</strong> Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces at home, work or school, especially when someone is ill.</li></ul><h3>School-Located Vaccination</h3><ul><li><a href="/flu/school/school_located_vac.htm">School-Located Vaccination Planning Materials and Templates</a></li><li><a href="/flu/school/slv/index.htm" shape="rect">Influenza School-located Vaccination (SLV): Information for Planners</a></li></ul><h3>Guidance and Resources</h3><ul><li><a href="/flu/school/guidance.htm">Guidance for School Administrators to Help Reduce the Spread of Seasonal Influenza in K-12 Schools</a><br/>This document provides seasonal flu recommendations for K-12 schools.</li><li><a href="/flu/swineflu/h3n2v-schools.htm">Supplemental Interim Guidance for School Administrators Associated with Possible Outbreaks of H3N2 Variant Influenza Virus ("H3N2v")</a></li><li><a href="/flu/school/cleaning.htm">How To Clean and Disinfect Schools to Help Slow the Spread of Flu</a><br/>This guide gives K-12 schools tips on how to clean to help slow the spread of seasonal flu.
