The meningococcal conjugate vaccine is recommended for all 11-18 year olds. Kids should get this vaccine at 11-12 years of age and a booster dose at age 16.</p></div><!-- END BANNER SECTION --><!-- CONTENT --><div class="subColumns"><p>Did you know that there are approximately 700-1,000 cases of meningococcal disease in the United States each year? Meningococcal disease can be very serious -- even life-threatening -- in 48 hours or less. Meningococcal disease can refer to any illness that is caused by <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em>, also known as meningococcus bacteria. The two most severe and common illnesses caused by <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> include meningitis (infection of the fluid and lining around the brain) and septicemia (bloodstream infection).</p><!-- ### Image Caption ### --><div class="c33r" style=" padding-left: 10px;"><div class="subcr"><div class="cdc-caption"><p align="center"><img alt="Photo: Two students" height="158" src="/features/meningococcal/meningococcal_a200px.jpg" width="200"/></p><p>About 15% of meningococcal disease survivors will have long-term disabilities, such as loss of limb(s), deafness, nervous system problems, or brain damage.</p></div></div></div><!-- ### /Image Caption ### --><h3>Symptoms of Meningococcal Disease</h3><p>Symptoms of meningococcal disease are usually sudden onset of fever, headache, and stiff neck. It can start with symptoms similar to influenza (flu), and will often also cause nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, rash, and confusion. Even with antibiotic treatment, people die in about 10-15% of cases. About 15% of survivors will have long-term disabilities, such as loss of limb(s), deafness, nervous system problems, or brain damage.</p><h3>How Meningococcal Disease Spreads</h3><p>Meningococcal disease can be spread from person to person. The bacteria are spread by exchanging respiratory and throat secretions during close (for example, coughing or kissing) or lengthy contact, especially if living in the same dorm or household. Many people carry the bacteria in their throats without getting meningococcal disease. Since so many people carry the bacteria, most cases of meningococcal disease appear to be random and aren't linked to other cases. Although anyone can get meningococcal disease, adolescents and college freshmen who live in dormitories are at an increased risk.</p><!-- ### Image Caption ### --><div class="c33r" style=" padding-left: 10px;"><div class="subcr"><div class="cdc-caption"><img alt="Photo: Use plain language and pictures, informing visitors how to keep safe and healthy when visiting animal exhibits." height="146" src="/features/meningococcal/meningococcal_b150px.jpg" width="194"/> <p><a href="/CDCTV/haveyouheard">Watch or download the video [4:42 mins]</a></p></div></div></div><!-- ### /Image Caption ### --><h3>Meningococcal Disease Prevention</h3><p>The good news is that there's a vaccine to help prevent meningococcal disease and it can prevent two of the three most common disease-causing strains. The vaccine is routinely recommended for all 11 through 18 year olds. Kids should get the first dose of this vaccine, known as the meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4), at their 11-12 year old check-up. Now, teenagers are recommended to get a booster dose at age 16. If your teenager missed getting the vaccine at his/her check-up, ask the doctor about getting it nowâ¦especially if your child is heading off to college to live in a dorm.</p><p>CDC created a video to help you learn more about meningococcal disease and how to prevent it. This video features a CDC doctor who is a mom and an expert in meningitis. You can download the video or podcast at <a href="/CDCTV">CDC-TV</a> or access it on your mobile phone.</p><h3>Vaccines for Teens</h3><p>Your preteen or adolescent is at risk for other diseases like pertussis (whooping cough) and HPV that can be prevented with vaccines. If your child hasn't had a check-up within the last year, make an appointment now and ask your child's doctor what vaccines are recommended.</p><div style=" clear: both;"><!-- --></div><h3 id="moreInfo">More Information</h3><ul><li style=" list-style: none;"><img alt="Logo: World Meningitis Day 2013" class="righty" height="172" src="/features/meningococcal/wmd_logo_2013.jpg" width="200"/></li><li><a href="/meningococcal/about/index.html">About Meningococcal Disease</a></li><li><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/mening/default.htm">Meningococcal vaccination</a></li><li><a href="/vaccines/parents/index.html">Vaccination resources for parents</a></li><li><a href="/vaccines/who/teens/for-parents.html">CDC information about preteen vaccines</a></li><li><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/index.html">The Vaccines for Children Program</a></li><li><a href="/vaccines/who/teens/for-public-health.html">Materials for state and local health departments</a></li><li><a href="/vaccines/who/teens/products/index.html">Posters, flyers, and PSAs from CDC Preteen and Teen Vaccine Campaign</a></li><li>Send a <a href="/vaccines/who/teens/products/web.html#ecards">Health-e-Card about preteen vaccines</a></li><li>Download video, <a href="/CDCTV/haveyouheard">Have You Heard?
