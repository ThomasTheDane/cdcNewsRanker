                  <h4>Should I get tested for HIV?</h4>
                  <div>
                  <p>CDC recommends that health care providers test everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 at least once as part of routine health care. One in six people in the United States who have HIV do not know they are infected.</p>
						      <p>HIV is spread through unprotected sex and drug-injecting behaviors    (plus mother to child), so people    who engage in these behaviors should get tested more often.    If you answer yes to any of the following    questions, you should definitely get an HIV test: </p>
						      <ul class="bulleted-links">
						        <li>Have you had <strong>unprotected</strong> sex (sex without a    condom)âanal, vaginal, or oralâwith men who have sex with men or with    multiple partners since your last HIV test? </li>
						        <li>Have you injected    drugs (including steroids, hormones, or silicone) and shared equipment (or <em>works</em>, such as needles and syringes)    with others? </li>
						        <li>Have you exchanged sex    for drugs or money? </li>
						       <li> Have you been diagnosed with or sought treatment for a <a class="noLinking" href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/healthcomm/fact_sheets.htm" style="display:inline">sexually transmitted  infection </a>(STI), like syphilis?</li>
                               <li>
Have you been diagnosed with or sought treatment for hepatitis or tuberculosis (TB)?</li>
						        <li>Have you had <strong>unprotected</strong> sex with someone who    could answer yes to any of the above questions or someone whose history you    don’t know? </li>
					          </ul>
						      <p>If you continue having unsafe sex or sharing    injection drug equipment, you should get tested at least once a year. Sexually    active gay and bisexual men may benefit from more frequent testing (e.g., every    3 to 6 months).</p>
						      <p>You should also get tested if</p>
				        <ul class="bulleted-links">
						        <li>You have    been sexually assaulted.</li>
						        <li>You are a woman who is    planning to get    pregnant or who is pregnant. </li>

                  <h4>I don’t believe I am at high risk. Why should I get tested?</h4>
                   <div class="inner">
                   <p>Some people who test positive for HIV were not aware of their    risk. That’s why CDC recommends that providers in all health care settings    make HIV testing a routine part of medical care for patients aged 13 to 64,    unless the patient declines (opts out). This practice would get more people    tested and help reduce the stigma around testing.</p>
				        <p> Even if you have been in a long-term relationship with one    person, you should find out for sure whether you or your partner has HIV. If    you are both HIV-negative and you both stay faithful (monogamous) and do not    have other risks for HIV infection, then you probably won’t need another HIV    test unless your situation changes.</p>

<h4>I am pregnant. Why should I get tested?</h4>
<div class="inner">
						      <p>HIV testing during each pregnancy is important    because, if your result is positive, treatment can improve your health and    greatly lower the chance that you will pass HIV to your infant before,    during, or after birth. The treatment is most effective for preventing HIV    transmission to babies when started as early as possible during pregnancy.    However, there are still great health benefits to beginning preventive treatment    even during labor or shortly after the baby is born.<br/>
						        <br/>
						        CDC recommends that health care providers    screen all pregnant women for HIV, talk to them about HIV or give them    written materials, and, for women with risk factors, provide referrals to    prevention counseling.</p>
						      <p> Screening all pregnant women for    HIV, and giving them the right medical care, helped decrease the number of    babies born with HIV from a high of 1,650  in 1991 to 127 in 2011.</p>

<h4>When should I get tested?</h4>
<div class="inner">
<p>The immune system usually takes 2    to 8 weeks to make antibodies against HIV (the average is 25 days). Although    most HIV tests look for these antibodies, some look for the virus itself. The    period after infection but before the test becomes positive is called the <em>window period</em>. <br/>
						        Deciding when to get tested therefore    depends on when you may have been exposed and which test is used. See "What    kind of tests are available and how do they work?" below.</p>
						      <p> A few people will have a longer    window period, so if you get a negative test result in the first 3 months    after possible exposure, you should get a repeat test after 3 months.    Ninety-seven percent of people will develop antibodies in the first 3 months    after they are infected. In very rare cases, it can take up to 6 months to    develop antibodies to HIV.</p>
						      <p> Between the time you were possibly exposed and when you    receive your test results: </p>
						      <ul class="bulleted-links">
						        <li>Don’t have sexâor    always use a condom if you do.</li>
						        <li>Don’t inject drugsâor always use clean equipment and don’t share    needles or other equipment (<em>works</em>).</li>

<h4>Where can I get tested?</h4>
<div class="inner">
 <p>You can ask your health care provider for an    HIV test. Many medical clinics, substance abuse programs, community health    centers, and hospitals offer them, too. You can also</p>

<h4>What kinds of tests are available, and how do they work?</h4>
<div class="inner">
<p>The most    common HIV test is the <strong>antibody screening test (<em>immunoassay</em>)</strong>, which tests for the antibodies that your body    makes against HIV. The immunoassay may be conducted    in a lab or as a rapid test at the testing site. It may be performed on blood    or oral fluid (not saliva). </p>
				        <p>Because    the level of antibody in oral fluid is lower than it is in blood, blood tests    tend to find infection sooner after exposure than do oral fluid tests. In addition, most blood-based lab    tests find infection sooner after exposure than rapid HIV tests. Newer immunoassay    tests can find HIV as soon as 3 weeks after exposure to the virus. Several    lab tests now in use can detect both antibodies and antigen (part of the    virus itself), so find recent infection earlier than tests that detect only    antibodies.</p>
						      <p> The <strong>rapid test</strong> is an immunoassay used for screening, and it produces quick results, in 20    minutes or less. Rapid tests use blood or oral fluid to look for antibodies    to HIV. If an immunoassay (lab test or rapid test) is conducted during the <em>window period</em> Â (i.e., the period    after exposure but before the test can find antibodies), the test may not find antibodies and    may give a false-negative result. All immunoassays that are positive need a    follow-up test to confirm the result. </p>
						      <p><strong>Follow-up diagnostic testing</strong> is    performed if the first immunoassay result is positive. Follow-up Â tests include; an antibody <em>differentiation test</em>, which    distinguishes HIV-1 from HIV-2; an <em>HIV-1    nucleic acid test</em>, which looks for virus directly, or the <em>Western blot</em> or indirect <em>immunofluorescence </em>assay, which detect    antibodies.</p>
						      <p>Immunoassays    are generally very accurate, but follow-up testing allows you and your health    care provider to be sure the diagnosis is right. If your first test is a    rapid test, and it is positive, you will be directed to a medical setting to    get follow-up testing. If your first test is a lab test, and it is positive,    the lab will conduct follow-up testing, usually on the same blood specimen as    the first test. </p>
						      <p>False-positive    tests are rare. If tests are conducted during the window period, they can give a false-negative result. </p>
				        <p>Currently there are only two home HIV tests: OraQuick In-home HIV test and the Home Access HIV-1 Test System. If you buy your home test online make sure the HIV test is FDA-approved. </p>
				        <p> The OraQuick In-Home HIV Test provides rapid results in the home.  The testing procedure involves swabbing your mouth for an oral fluid sample and  using a kit to test it. Results are available in 20 minutes. If you test  positive, you will need a follow-up test. The manufacturer provides  confidential counseling and referral to follow-up testing sites. Because the  level of antibody in oral fluid is lower than it is in blood, oral fluid tests  find infection later after exposure than do blood tests. Up to 1 in 12 people  may test false-negative with these tests.</p>
                        <p>The Home HIV Access HIV-1 Test System is a home collection kit,  which involves pricking your finger to collect a blood sample, sending the  sample to a licensed laboratory, then calling in for results a few days later.  If the test is positive, a follow-up test is performed right away. This test is  anonymous. The manufacturer provides confidential counseling and referral to  treatment. The tests conducted on the sample collected at home find infection  later than most lab-based tests offered by providers.</p>
                        <p><strong>RNA tests</strong> detect the    virus directly (instead of the antibodies to HIV) and thus can detect HIV at    about 10 days after infectionâas soon as it appears in the bloodstream,    before antibodies develop. These tests cost more than antibody tests and are    generally not used as a screening test, although your doctor may order one as    a follow-up test, after a positive antibody test, or as part of a clinical    workup. </p>

<h4>What should I expect when I go in for an HIV test?</h4>
<div class="inner">
<p>When it’s time to take the test, a health care    provider will take your sample (blood or oral fluid) and you may be able to    wait for the results (if it’s a rapid HIV test). If the test comes back    negative, and you haven’t had an exposure for 3 months, Â you can be confident you’re not infected    with HIV. </p>
						      <p>If your test comes back positive, you will    need to get a follow-up test, which the testing site will arrange. </p>
				        <p>Your health care provider or counselor may    talk with you about your risk factors, answer questions about your general    health, and discuss next steps with you, especially if your result is    positive. </p>
						      <p>See "Will other people know my test result?						      " below.</p>

<h4>What does a negative test result mean?</h4>
<div class="inner">
<p>A negative result does not necessarily mean that you don't have HIV. That's because of the window periodâthe period after you may have been exposed to HIV  but before a test can detect it. The window period depends on the kind of test that was used on your blood or oral fluid. For antibody tests, if you get a negative result within 3 months of your most recent possible exposure, you need to get tested again at the 3-month mark. For RNA tests or antibody/antigen tests, that timeframe may be shorter. Ask your health care provider if and when you need to be retested with a negative test result. And meanwhile, practice abstinence or mutual monogamy with a trusted partner, use condoms every time you have sex (and for every sex actâanal, oral, or vaginal), and don't share needles and other drug equipment (works).</p>
</div>
<!--END OF SECTION-->

<!--BEGINNING OF ACCORDIAN SECTION/ TAB-->
<h4>If I have a negative result, does that mean that my partner is HIV-negative also?</h4>
<div class="inner">
<p>No. Your HIV test result reveals only your HIV    status. HIV is not necessarily transmitted every time you have sex.    Therefore, taking an HIV test is not a way to find out if your partner is    infected. Ask your partner if he or she has been tested for HIV and about his    or her risk behaviors, both now and in the past. Consider getting tested    together, often referred to as couples testing. </p>
</div>
<!--END OF SECTION-->

<!--BEGINNING OF ACCORDIAN SECTION/ TAB--> 
<h4>What does a positive result mean?</h4>
<div class="inner">
<p>If you had a rapid screening test, the    testing site will arrange a follow-up test to make sure the screening test    result was correct. If your blood was tested in a lab, the lab will conduct a    follow-up test on the same sample. If the follow-up test is also positive, it    means you are HIV-positive.</p>
						      <p>The sooner you take steps to protect your    health, the better. Early treatment with antiretroviral drugs and a healthy    lifestyle can help you stay well. Prompt medical care prevents the onset of <a class="noLinking" href="/hiv/basics/whatishiv.html" style="display:inline">AIDS</a> and some life-threatening conditions. </p>
						      <p>Here are some important steps you can take right    away to protect your health:<br/>
					          </p>
						      <ul class="bulleted-links">
						        <li><strong>See a licensed health care provider, even if you don’t feel    sick.</strong> Your <a class="noLinking" href="http://www.naccho.org/about/lhd/" style="display:inline">local    health department</a> can help you find a    health care provider who has experience treating HIV. There are medicines to    treat HIV infection and help you stay healthy. It’s never too early to start treatment.    Current guidelines recommend treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) for    all people with HIV, including those with early infection.</li>
						        <li>Get screened for other    sexually transmitted infections (STIs). STIs can cause serious health    problems, even when they don’t cause symptoms. Using a condom during all    sexual contact (anal, vaginal, or oral) can help prevent many STIs.</li>
						        <li>Have a TB    (tuberculosis) test. You may be infected with TB and not know it. Undetected    TB can cause serious illness, but it can be successfully treated if caught    early. </li>
						        <li>Get help if you smoke    cigarettes, drink too much alcohol, or use illegal drugs (such as    methamphetamine), which can weaken your immune system. Find <a class="noLinking" href="http://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/TreatmentLocator/faces/quickSearch.jspx" style="display:inline">substance abuse treatment facilities</a> near you. </li>
					          </ul>
						      <p>Â To avoid giving HIV to anyone else, </p>
				        <ul class="bulleted-links">
						        <li>Tell your    partner or partners about your HIV status before you have any type of sexual    contact with them (anal, vaginal, or oral).</li>
						        <li>Use latex condoms    and/or dental dams with every sexual contact. If either partner is allergic    to latex, plastic (polyurethane) condoms for either the male or female can be    used. </li>
						        <li>Don’t share needles,    syringes, or other drug paraphernalia with anyone. </li>
						        <li>Stay on ART to keep    your virus under control and greatly reduce your ability to spread HIV to    others.</li>
						        <li>If your steady partner    is HIV-negative, discuss whether he or she should consider <a class="noLinking" href="/hiv/prevention/research/prep/index.html" style="display:inline">pre-exposure    prophylaxis (PrEP)</a>âmedications to <em>prevent</em> HIV. </li>

<h4>If I test positive for HIV, does that mean I have AIDS?</h4>
<div class="inner">
<p>No. Being    HIV-positive does not mean you have AIDS.    AIDS is the most advanced stage of HIV disease. Proper treatment can keep you from developing AIDS.</p>

<h4>Will other people know my test result?</h4>
<div class="inner">
Your test results are protected by state    and federal privacy laws. They can only be released with your permission. Whether    anyone can know about your test results or your HIV status depends on what    kind of test you take: confidential or anonymous. Some states    only offer confidential testing. <p></p>
						      <ul class="bulleted-links">
						        <li><strong>Confidential testing</strong> means that your name and other identifying         information will be attached to your test results. The results will go         in your medical record and may be shared with your health care providers         and your health insurance company. Otherwise, the results are protected         by state and federal privacy laws.</li>
						        <li><strong>Anonymous testing</strong> means that nothing ties your test results to you.         When you take an anonymous HIV test, you get a unique identifier that         allows you to get your test results. </li>
			            </ul>
				        <p>With confidential testing, if you test positive for HIV    or another STI, the test result and your name will be reported to the state or    local health department to help public health officials get better estimates    of the rates of HIV in the state. The state health department will then <strong>remove all personal information</strong> about you (name, address, etc.) and share the remaining non-identifying    information with CDC. CDC does not share this information with anyone else,    including insurance companies.</p>

<h4>Should I share my positive test result with others?</h4>
<div class="inner">
<p>Whether you share, or <em>disclose</em>, your status to others is    your decision.</p>
						      <p><strong>Partners</strong><br/>
						        If you test positive for HIV, your sex or drug-using partners may also be    infected. It’s important that they know they have been exposed so that they    can be tested too. </p>
				        <p>You can tell them yourselfâbut if you’re nervous about disclosing your    test result, or you have been threatened or injured by your partner,    you can ask your doctor or the local health department to tell them that they    might have been exposed to HIV. Health departments do not reveal your name to    your partners. They will only tell your partners that they have been exposed    to HIV and should get tested.</p>
						      <p>Most states have laws that require you to tell your sexual    partners if you are HIV-positive <strong>before</strong> you have sex (anal, vaginal,    or oral) or share drugs. You can be charged with a crime in some states if    you don’t tellâeven if your partner doesn’t become infected.</p>
						      <p><strong>Family    and friends</strong><br/>
						        In most cases, your family and friends will not know your test results or HIV    status unless you tell them yourself. While telling your family that    you have HIV may seem hard, you should know that disclosure actually has many    benefitsâstudies have shown that people who disclose their HIV status respond    better to treatment than those who don’t.</p>
						      <p> If you are under 18, however, some states allow your    health care provider to tell your parent(s) that you received services for    sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, if they think doing so is in    your best interest. For more information, see the Guttmacher Institute’s <a class="noLinking" href="http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_MASS.pdf" style="display:inline">State Policies in    Brief: Minors’ Access to STI Services</a>.</p>
						      <p><strong>Employers</strong><br/>
				        In most cases, your employer will not know your HIV status unless you tell.    But your employer does have a right to ask if you have any health conditions    that would affect your ability to do your job or pose a serious risk to    others. (An example might be a health care professional, like a surgeon, who    does procedures where there is a risk of blood or other body fluids being    exchanged.)</p>
				        <p>If you have health insurance through your employer, the    insurance company cannot <strong>legally</strong> tell your employer that you have HIV. But it is possible that your employer    could find out if the insurance company provides detailed information to your    employer about the benefits it pays or the costs of insurance.</p>
						      <p>All people with HIV are covered under the Americans with    Disabilities Act. This means that your employer cannot discriminate against    you because of your HIV status as long as you can do your job.

<p> If you have insurance, your insurer may pay for treatment.  If you do not have insurance, or your insurer will not pay for treatment,  government programs, such as Medicaid, Medicare, Ryan White Care Act treatment  centers, and community health centers may be able to help if you meet their  rules for eligibility (usually low income and/or disability). CDC is working  with its federal partners to make sure that all people who need treatment can  get it. Your health care provider or local public health department can direct you to HIV treatment programs. </p>
