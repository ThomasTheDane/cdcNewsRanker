              <h3>Tuberculosis: General Information</h3>     

              
              <h4>What is TB?</h4>
              <p> Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by germs that are spread 
                from person to person through the air. TB usually affects the 
                lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body, such as 
                the brain, the kidneys, or the spine. A person with TB can die 
                if they do not get treatment. </p>
              <h4>What Are the Symptoms of TB?</h4>
              <p> The general symptoms of TB disease include feelings of sickness 
                or weakness, weight loss, fever, and night sweats. The symptoms 
                of TB disease of the lungs also include coughing, chest pain, 
                and the coughing up of blood. Symptoms of TB disease in other 
                parts of the body depend on the area affected.</p>
              <h4>How is TB Spread?</h4>
              <p> TB germs are put into the air when a person with TB disease 
                of the lungs or throat coughs, sneezes, speaks, or sings. These 
                germs can stay in the air for several hours, depending on the 
                environment. Persons who breathe in the air containing these TB 
                germs can become infected; this is called latent TB infection. 
              </p>
              <h4>What is the Difference Between Latent TB Infection and TB Disease?</h4>
              <p> People with <em>latent TB infection</em> have TB germs in their 
                bodies, but they are not sick because the germs are not active. 
                These people do not have symptoms of TB disease, and they cannot 
                spread the germs to others. However, they may develop TB disease 
                in the future. They are often prescribed treatment to prevent 
                them from developing TB disease. </p>
              <p>People with TB disease are sick from TB germs that are active, 
                meaning that they are multiplying and destroying tissue in their 
                body. They usually have symptoms of TB disease. People with TB 
                disease of the lungs or throat are capable of spreading germs 
                to others. They are prescribed drugs that can 
				treat TB disease.</p>
              <h4>What Should I Do If I Have Spent Time with Someone with Latent 
                TB Infection?</h4>
              <p> A person with latent TB infection cannot spread germs to other 
                people. You do not need to be tested if you have spent time with 
                someone with latent TB infection. However, if you have spent time 
                with someone with TB disease or someone with symptoms of TB, you 
                should be tested. </p>
              <h4>What Should I Do if I Have Been Exposed to Someone with TB 
                Disease? </h4>
              <p> People with TB disease are most likely to spread the germs to 
                people they spend time with every day, such as family members 
                or coworkers.<strong> If you have been around someone who 
                has TB disease, you should go to your doctor or your local health 
                department for tests. </strong></p>
              <h4>How Do You Get Tested for TB? </h4>
              <p> There are two tests that can be used to help detect TB infection: a skin test or   TB blood test. The
				Mantoux tuberculin skin test is performed by injecting a small amount of fluid (called tuberculin) into the skin 
				in the lower part of the arm. A person given the tuberculin skin test must 
				return within 48 to 72 hours to have a trained health care worker look for a reaction on the arm. The  TB blood tests measure how the 
				patient’s immune system reacts to the germs that cause TB.</p>
              <h4>What Does a Positive Test for TB Infection Mean?</h4>
              <p> A positive test for TB infection only tells that a person has been infected with TB germs. It does not tell whether or not the person has progressed to TB disease. Other tests, such as a chest x-ray and a
				sample of sputum, are needed to see whether the person has TB disease.</p>
              <h4>What is Bacille CalmetteâGuèrin (BCG)?</h4>
              <p> BCG is a vaccine for TB disease. BCG is used in many countries, 
                but it is not generally recommended in the United States. BCG 
                vaccination does not completely prevent people from getting TB. 
                It may also cause a false positive tuberculin skin test. However, 
                persons who have been vaccinated with BCG can be given a tuberculin 
                skin test or  TB blood test. </p>
              <h4>Why is Latent TB Infection Treated?</h4>
              <p> If you have latent TB infection but not TB disease, your doctor 
                may want you to take a drug to kill the TB germs and prevent you 
                from developing TB disease. The decision about taking treatment 
                for latent infection will be based on your chances of developing 
                TB disease. Some people are more likely than others to develop 
                TB disease once they have TB infection. This includes people with 
                HIV infection, people who were recently exposed to someone with 
                TB disease, and people with certain medical conditions. </p>
              <h4>How is TB Disease Treated? </h4>
              <p>TB disease can be treated by taking several drugs for 6 to 12 months. 
                It is very important that people who have TB disease finish the 
                medicine, and take the drugs exactly as prescribed. If they stop 
                taking the drugs too soon, they can become sick again; if they 
                do not take the drugs correctly, the germs that are still alive 
                may become resistant to those drugs. TB that is resistant to drugs 
                is harder and more expensive to treat. In some situations, staff 
                of the local health department meet regularly with patients who 
                have TB to watch them take their medications. This is called directly 
                observed therapy (DOT). DOT helps the patient complete treatment 
                in the least amount of time. </p>
