Schools are key to supporting effective HIV/STD prevention among youth. Learn what schools can do to support HIV/STD prevention and testing.</p></div><div class="subColumns"><h3>Why schools?</h3><p>Just as schools are critical settings for preparing students academically, they are also vital partners in helping young people take responsibility for their own health. School health programs can help youth adopt lifelong attitudes and behaviors that support overall health and well-beingâincluding behaviors that can reduce their risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).</p><p>In the United States, schools have direct contact with more than 50 million students for at least 6 hours a day during 13 critical years of their social, physical, and intellectual development. After the family home, schools are the primary places responsible for the development of young people. This gives schools an opportunity to play an important role in HIV and STD prevention.</p><h3>What can schools do to support HIV and STD prevention?</h3><p><img alt="Photo: Teenage boy and girl" class="stroke righty" height="264" src="/features/hivstdprevention/hivstdprevention_a200px.jpg" width="200"/>Research shows that well-designed, well-implemented HIV/STD prevention programs can significantly reduce sexual risk behaviors among youth. A review of 48 comprehensive curriculum-based sex and STD/HIV education programs found that about two-thirds of the HIV/STD prevention programs studied had a significant impact on reducing sexual risk behaviors,<sup>1-2</sup> including</p><ul><li>A delay in first sexual intercourse,</li><li>A decline in the number of sex partners, and</li><li>An increase in condom or contraceptive use.</li></ul><p>None increased the likelihood of having sex.<sup>1-2</sup></p><p>Schools also can conduct programs to teach youth how to solve problems, communicate with others, and plan for the future. Evidence indicates that such youth asset-development programs can be associated with longer-term reductions in sexual risk behaviors.<sup>3</sup></p><h3>What can schools do to support HIV and STD testing?</h3><p>Making HIV testing* a routine part of health care for adolescents and adults aged 13â64 years is an important strategy recommended by CDC to reduce the spread of HIV.<sup>4</sup> HIV testing is also an integral part of the <em>National HIV/AIDS Strategy</em> to prevent the spread of HIV and improve health outcomes for those who are already infected.<sup>5</sup></p><p>State and local education agencies and schools are essential partners in this effort. Schools can help support HIV and STD testing byâ</p><ul><li>Teaching students about HIV and other STDs.</li><li>Promoting communication between parents and adolescents.</li><li>Teaching students how to find HIV counseling and testing services.</li><li>Providing referrals to testing, counseling, and treatment services.</li><li>Providing on-site testing for HIV and STDs.</li></ul><div class="module rounders"><div class="inner"><div class="t"></div><div class="subColumns"><div class="subc"><h3>HIV and STD Testing Resources</h3><ul class="bulleted-links"><li><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/testing/index.htm">CDC HIV Testing</a></li><li><a href="http://www.hivtest.org" target="_blank">National HIV and STD Testing Resources, a searchable database of testing sites by city, state, and ZIP code</a></li><li><a href="http://www.adolescentaids.org" target="_blank">Adolescent AIDS Program information about youth-friendly HIV testing, counseling, and care</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="b"><div></div></div></div><h3>CDC's Division of Adolescent and School Health (DASH): Supporting HIV and STD Prevention Efforts</h3><p>Sexual risk behaviors place adolescents at risk for HIV infection and other STDs:</p><ul><li>In 2010, of the estimated 47,500 new HIV infections in the United States, 12,200 were among youths aged 13â24 years.<sup>6</sup></li><li>Nearly half of the 19 million new STDs each year are among young people aged 15â24 years.<sup>7</sup></li></ul><p>DASH provides funding and other assistance that enables state and local education agencies to deliver HIV prevention programs that are scientifically sound and grounded in the latest research on effectiveness.
