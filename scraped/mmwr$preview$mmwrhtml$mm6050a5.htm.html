				<img alt="The figure shows the percentage of employed adults aged 18-64 years with current asthma, skin condition, or carpal tunnel syndrome, who were told their condition was work-related, by sex during 2010, according to the National Health Interview Survey. In 2010, among employed adults aged 18-64 years who currently had asthma, 6.7% had been told their current asthma was work-related. Among employed adults who had a skin condition, 5.8% had been told their skin condition was work-related. Among employed adults who had carpal tunnel syndrome, 69.4% had been told their carpal tunnel syndrome was work-related. Men (61.1%) were less likely than women (73.2%) to have been told their carpal tunnel syndrome was work-related. No significant differences by sex for either work-related current asthma or skin conditions were observed." src="figures\m6050qsf.gif"/>
