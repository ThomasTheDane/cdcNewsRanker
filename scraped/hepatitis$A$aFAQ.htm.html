        <h2>Overview</h2>
		
			<a name="whatHep"></a>
            <h4>What is hepatitis?</h4>
		<p>âHepatitisâ means inflammation of the liver. Toxins, certain drugs, some 
		diseases, heavy alcohol use, and bacterial and viral infections can all 
		cause hepatitis. Hepatitis is also the name of a family of viral infections 
		that affect the
		<a onclick="
		if (window.showModelessDialog) {
		 win = window.showModalDialog('../TheLiver.htm', window,'status:no;dialogHeight: 220px');
		} else {
		win = window.open('../TheLiver.htm',window);
		}" onfocus="this.blur();" onmouseover='this.style.cursor="pointer" '><span style="text-decoration: underline;">liver</span></a>; the most 
		common types are Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C.</p>
		
			<a name="abDiffer"></a>
            <h4>What is the difference between Hepatitis A, Hepatitis 
			B, and Hepatitis C?</h4>
		<p><a class="narrativeLink" href="index.htm">Hepatitis A</a>,
		<a class="narrativeLink" href="../B/index.htm">Hepatitis B</a>, and
		<a class="narrativeLink" href="../C/index.htm">Hepatitis C</a> are diseases 
		caused by three different viruses. Although each can cause similar symptoms, 
		they have different modes of transmission and can affect the liver differently. 
		Hepatitis A appears only as an acute or newly occurring infection and does 
		not become chronic. People with Hepatitis A usually improve without treatment. 
		Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C can also begin as acute infections, but in some 
		people, the virus remains in the body, resulting in chronic disease and 
		long term liver problems. There are vaccines to prevent Hepatitis A and 
		B; however, there is not one for Hepatitis C. If a person has had one type 
		of viral hepatitis in the past, it is still possible to get the other types.		</p>
		
			<a name="whatHepA"></a>
            <h4>What is Hepatitis A? </h4>
		<p>Hepatitis A is a contagious liver disease that results from infection 
		with the Hepatitis A virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness 
		lasting a few weeks to a severe illness lasting several months. Hepatitis 
		A is usually spread when a person ingests fecal matter â even in microscopic 
		amounts â from contact with objects, food, or drinks contaminated by the 
		feces, or stool, of an infected person. </p>
		<p> </p>
		<a name="statistics"></a>
        <h2>Statistics</h2>
		
			<a name="UScommon"></a>
            <h4>How common is Hepatitis A in the United States?</h4>
		<p>In the United States, there were an estimated 25,000 new Hepatitis A 
		virus infections in 2007. (However, the official number of reported Hepatitis 
		A cases is much lower since many people who are infected never have symptoms 
		and are never reported to public health officials.)</p>
		
			<a name="USdecrease"></a>
            <h4>Is Hepatitis A decreasing in the United States?</h4>
		<p>Yes. Rates of Hepatitis A in the United States are the lowest they have 
		been in 40 years. The Hepatitis A vaccine was introduced in 1995 and health 
		professionals now routinely vaccinate all children, travelers to certain 
		countries, and persons at risk for the disease. Many experts believe Hepatitis 
		A vaccination has dramatically affected rates of the disease in the United 
		States.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<a name="transmission"></a>
        <h2>Transmission / Exposure</h2>
		
			<a name="spread"></a>
            <h4>How is Hepatitis A spread? </h4>
		<p>Hepatitis A is usually spread when the Hepatitis A virus is taken in 
		by mouth from contact with objects, food, or drinks contaminated by the 
		feces (or stool) of an infected person. A person can get Hepatitis A through:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Person to person contact<ul>
				<li>when an infected person does not wash his or her hands properly 
				after going to the bathroom and touches other objects or food</li>
				<li>when a parent or caregiver does not properly wash his or her 
				hands after changing diapers or cleaning up the stool of an infected 
				person</li>
				<li>when someone has sex or sexual contact  with an infected person. (not limited to anal-oral contact) </li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Contaminated food or water<ul>
				<li>Hepatitis A can be spread by eating or drinking food or water 
				contaminated with the virus. (This can include frozen or undercooked food.) This is more likely to occur in countries 
				where Hepatitis A is common and in areas where there are poor sanitary 
				conditions or poor personal hygiene. The food and drinks most likely 
				to be contaminated are fruits, vegetables, shellfish, ice, and water. 
				In the United States, chlorination of water kills Hepatitis A virus 
				that enters the water supply. </li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		
			<a name="risk"></a>
            <h4>Who is at risk for Hepatitis A? </h4>
		<p class="bulletListIntro">Although anyone can get Hepatitis A, in the United 
		States, certain groups of people are at higher risk, such as those who:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Travel to or live in
			<a class="narrativeLink" href="http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-HepA.aspx#362" target="OffSite">
			countries where Hepatitis A is common</a></li>
			<li>Are men who have sexual contact with other men</li>
			<li>Use illegal drugs, whether injected or not</li>
			<li>Have clotting-factor disorders, such as hemophilia</li>
			<li>Live with someone who has Hepatitis A</li>
			<li>Have oral-anal sexual contact with someone who has Hepatitis A
			</li>
		</ul>
		
			<a name="exposed"></a>
            <h4>I think I have been exposed to Hepatitis A. What 
			should I do?</h4>
		<p>If you have any questions about potential exposure to Hepatitis A, call 
		your health professional or your local or
		<a class="narrativeLink" href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/international/relres.html">
		state health department</a>. </p>
		<p>If you were recently exposed to Hepatitis A virus and have not been vaccinated 
		against Hepatitis A, you might benefit from an injection of either
		<a class="narrativeLink" href="#vacIG">immune globulin</a> or Hepatitis 
		A vaccine. However, the vaccine or immune globulin must be given within 
		the first 2 weeks after exposure to be effective. A health professional 
		can decide what is best on the basis of your age and overall health.</p>
		
			<a name="restaurant"></a>
            <h4>What should I do if I ate at a restaurant that 
			had an outbreak of Hepatitis A?</h4>
		<p>Talk to your health professional or a local health department official 
		for guidance. Outbreaks usually result from one of two sources of contamination: 
		an infected food handler or an infected food source. Your health department 
		will investigate the cause of the outbreak.</p>
		<p>Keep in mind that most people do not get sick when someone at a restaurant 
		has Hepatitis A. However, if an infected food handler is infectious and 
		has poor hygiene, the risk goes up for patrons of that restaurant. In such 
		cases, health officials might try to identify patrons and provide Hepatitis 
		A vaccine or <a class="narrativeLink" href="#vacIG">immune globulin</a> 
		if they can find them within 2 weeks of exposure.</p>
		<p>On rare occasions, the source of the infection can be traced to contaminated 
		food. Foods can become contaminated at any point along the process: growing, 
		harvesting, processing, handling, and even after cooking. In these cases, 
		health officials will try to determine the source of the contamination and 
		the best ways to minimize health threats to the public. </p>
		
			<a name="postexp"></a>
            <h4>What is postexposure prophylaxis or PEP?</h4>
		<p>PEP or postexposure prophylaxis refers to trying to prevent or treat 
		a disease after someone is exposed to it.</p>
		
			<a name="whoPEP"></a>
            <h4>Who should get PEP after being exposed to Hepatitis 
			A?</h4>
		<p class="bulletListIntro">A health professional can decide whether or not 
		a person needs PEP after exposure to Hepatitis A. People who might benefit 
		from PEP include those who:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Live with someone who has Hepatitis A</li>
			<li>Have recently had sexual contact with someone who has Hepatitis 
			A</li>
			<li>Have recently shared injection or non-injection illegal drugs with 
			someone who has Hepatitis A</li>
			<li>Have had ongoing, close personal contact with a person with Hepatitis 
			A, such as a regular babysitter or caregiver</li>
			<li>Have been exposed to food or water known to be contaminated with 
			Hepatitis A virus </li>
		</ul>
		
			<a name="getAgain"></a>
            <h4>If I have had Hepatitis A in the past, can I 
			get it again?</h4>
		<p>No. Once you recover from Hepatitis A, you develop antibodies that protect 
		you from the virus for life. An antibody is a substance found in the blood 
		that the body produces in response to a virus. Antibodies protect the body 
		from disease by attaching to the virus and destroying it.</p>
		
			<a name="giveBlood"></a>
            <h4>Can I donate blood if I have had Hepatitis A?</h4>
		<p>If you had Hepatitis A when you were 11 years of age or older, you cannot 
		donate blood. If you had Hepatitis A before age 11, you may be able donate 
		blood. Check with your blood donation center.</p>
		
			<a name="survive"></a>
            <h4>How long does Hepatitis A virus survive outside 
			the body?</h4>
		<p>The Hepatitis A virus is extremely hearty. It is able to survive the 
		bodyâs highly acidic digestive tract and can live outside the body for months. 
		High temperatures, such as boiling or cooking food or liquids for at least 
		1 minute at 185Â°F (85Â°C), kill the virus, although freezing temperatures 
		do not.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<a name="symptoms"></a>
        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
		
			<a name="causesymptoms"></a>
            <h4>Does Hepatitis A cause symptoms?</h4>
		<p>Not always. Some people get Hepatitis A and have no symptoms of the disease. 
		Adults are more likely to have symptoms than children. </p>
		
			<a name="symptoms"></a>
            <h4>What are the symptoms of Hepatitis A? </h4>
		<p class="bulletListIntro">Some people with Hepatitis A do not have any 
		symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they may include the following:</p>
		<p> </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Fever</li>
			<li>Fatigue</li>
			<li>Loss of appetite</li>
			<li>Nausea</li>
			<li>Vomiting</li>
			<li>Abdominal pain</li>
			<li>Dark urine</li>
			<li>Clay-colored bowel movements</li>
			<li>Joint pain</li>
			<li>Jaundice (a yellowing of the skin or eyes)</li>
		</ul>
		
			<a name="howSoon"></a>
            <h4>How soon after exposure to Hepatitis A will symptoms 
			appear?</h4>
		<p>If symptoms occur, they usually appear anywhere from 2 to 6 weeks after 
		exposure. Symptoms usually develop over a period of several days.</p>
		
			<a name="howLong"></a>
            <h4>How long do Hepatitis A symptoms last?</h4>
		<p>Symptoms usually last less than 2 months, although some people can be 
		ill for as long as 6 months.</p>
		
			<a name="noSymptoms"></a>
            <h4>Can a person spread Hepatitis A without having 
			symptoms?</h4>
		<p>Yes. Many people, especially children, have no symptoms. In addition, 
		a person can transmit the virus to others up to 2 weeks before symptoms 
		appear.</p>
		
			<a name="howSerious"></a>
            <h4>How serious is Hepatitis A?</h4>
		<p>Almost all people who get Hepatitis A recover completely and do not have 
		any lasting liver damage, although they may feel sick for months. Hepatitis 
		A can sometimes cause liver failure and death, although this is rare and 
		occurs more commonly in persons 50 years of age or older and persons with 
		other liver diseases, such as Hepatitis B or C.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<a name="diagnosis"></a>
        <h2>Diagnosis / Treatment</h2>
		
			<a name="howKnow"></a>
            <h4>How will I know if I have Hepatitis A?</h4>
		<p>A doctor can determine if you have Hepatitis A by discussing your symptoms 
		and taking a blood sample. </p>
		
			<a name="howTreated"></a>
            <h4>How is Hepatitis A treated?</h4>
		<p>There are no special treatments for Hepatitis A. Most people with Hepatitis 
		A will feel sick for a few months before they begin to feel better. A few 
		people will need to be hospitalized. During this time, doctors usually recommend 
		rest, adequate nutrition, and fluids. People with Hepatitis A should check 
		with a health professional before taking any prescription pills, supplements, 
		or over-the-counter medications, which can potentially damage the liver. 
		Alcohol should be avoided.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<a name="prevention"></a>
        <h2>Prevention / Vaccination</h2>
		
			<a name="prevent"></a>
            <h4>Can Hepatitis A be prevented?</h4>
		<p>Yes. The best way to prevent Hepatitis A is through vaccination with 
		the Hepatitis A vaccine. Vaccination is recommended for all children, for 
		travelers to certain countries, and for people at high risk for infection 
		with the virus. Frequent handwashing with soap and warm water after using 
		the bathroom, changing a diaper, or before preparing food can help prevent 
		the spread of Hepatitis A.</p>
		
			<a name="prevent"></a>
            <h4>What is the Hepatitis A vaccine?</h4>
		<p>The Hepatitis A vaccine is a shot of inactive Hepatitis A virus that 
		stimulates the body's natural immune system. After the vaccine is given, 
		the body makes antibodies that protect a person against the virus. An antibody 
		is a substance found in the blood that is produced in response to a virus 
		invading the body. These antibodies are then stored in the body and will 
		fight off the infection if a person is exposed to the virus in the future.</p>
		
			<a name="vacWho"></a>
            <h4>Who should get vaccinated against Hepatitis A?</h4>
		<p class="bulletListIntro">Hepatitis A vaccination is recommended for:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>All children at age 1 year</li>
			<li>Travelers to countries that have high rates of Hepatitis A</li>
			<li>Men who have sexual contact with other men</li>
			<li>Users of injection and non-injection illegal drugs</li>
			<li>People with chronic (lifelong) liver diseases, such as Hepatitis 
			B or Hepatitis C</li>
			<li>People who are treated with clotting-factor concentrates</li>
			<li>People who work with Hepatitis A infected animals or in a Hepatitis 
			A research laboratory </li>
		</ul>
		
			<a name="vacHow"></a>
            <h4>How is the Hepatitis A vaccine given?</h4>
		<p>The Hepatitis A vaccine is given as 2 shots, 6 months apart. The Hepatitis 
		A vaccine also comes in a combination form, containing both Hepatitis A 
		and B vaccine, that can be given to persons 18 years of age and older. This 
		form is given as 3 shots, over a period of 6 months. </p>
		
			<a name="vacEffective"></a>
            <h4>Is the Hepatitis A vaccine effective?</h4>
		<p>Yes, the Hepatitis A vaccine is highly effective in preventing Hepatitis 
		A virus infection. Protection begins approximately 2 to 4 weeks after the 
		first injection. A second injection results in long-term protection.</p>
		
			<a name="vacSafe"></a>
            <h4>Is the Hepatitis A vaccine safe?</h4>
		<p>Yes, the Hepatitis A vaccine is safe. No serious side effects have resulted 
		from the Hepatitis A vaccine. Soreness at the injection site is the most 
		common side effect reported. As with any medicine, there are very small 
		risks that a serious problem could occur after someone gets the vaccine. 
		However, the potential risks associated with Hepatitis A are much greater 
		than the potential risks associated with the Hepatitis A vaccine. Before 
		the Hepatitis A vaccine became available in the Unites States, more than 
		250,000 people were infected with Hepatitis A virus each year. Since the 
		licensure of the first Hepatitis A vaccine in 1995, millions of doses of 
		Hepatitis A vaccine have been given in the United States and worldwide.</p>
		
			<a name="vacWhoNot"></a>
            <h4>Who should not receive the Hepatitis A vaccine?</h4>
		<p>People who have ever had a serious allergic reaction to the Hepatitis 
		A vaccine or who are known to be allergic to any part of the Hepatitis A 
		vaccine should not receive the vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any 
		severe allergies. Also, the vaccine is not licensed for use in infants under 
		age 1 year.</p>
		
			<a name="vacWhoNot"></a>
            <h4>Who should get the Hepatitis A vaccine before 
			traveling?</h4>
		<p>Anyone traveling to or working in countries with high rates of Hepatitis 
		A should talk to a health professional about getting vaccinated. He or she 
		is likely to recommend vaccination or a shot of
		<a class="narrativeLink" href="#vacIG">immune globulin</a> before traveling 
		to countries in Central or South America, Mexico, and certain parts of Asia, 
		Africa, and Eastern Europe. CDCâs Travelersâ Health site provides detailed 
		information about Hepatitis A and other recommended vaccines at
		<a href="http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCH4-HepA.aspx">wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCH4-HepA.aspx</a>.</p>
		
			<a name="vacIG"></a>
            <h4>What is immune globulin?</h4>
		<p>Immune globulin is a substance made from human blood plasma that contains 
		antibodies that protect against infection. It is given as a shot and provides 
		short-term protection (approximately 3 months) against Hepatitis A. Immune 
		globulin can be given either before exposure to the Hepatitis A virus (such 
		as before travel to a country where Hepatitis A is common) or to prevent 
		infection after exposure to the Hepatitis A virus. Immune globulin must 
		be given within 2 weeks after exposure for the best protection.</p>
		
			<a name="vacWhyTrav"></a>
            <h4>Why is the Hepatitis A vaccine recommended 
			before traveling?</h4>
		<p>Traveling to
		<a class="narrativeLink" href="http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-HepA.aspx#362">
		places where Hepatitis A virus is common</a> puts a person at high risk 
		for Hepatitis A. The risk exists even for travelers to urban areas, those 
		who stay in luxury hotels, and those who report that they have good hygiene 
		and are careful about what they eat and drink. Travelers can minimize their 
		risk by avoiding potentially contaminated water or food, such as drinking 
		beverages (with or without ice) of unknown purity, eating uncooked shellfish, 
		and eating uncooked fruits or vegetables that are not peeled or prepared 
		by the traveler personally. Risk for infection increases with duration of 
		travel and is highest for those who live in or visit rural areas, trek in 
		back-country areas, or frequently eat or drink in settings with poor sanitation. 
		Since a simple, safe vaccine exists, experts recommend that travelers to 
		certain countries be vaccinated.</p>
		
			<a name="vacHowSoonTrav"></a>
            <h4>How soon before travel should the Hepatitis 
			A vaccine be given?</h4>
		<p>The first dose of Hepatitis A vaccine should be given as soon as travel 
		is planned. Two weeks or more before departure is ideal, but anytime before 
		travel will provide some protection.</p>
		
			<a name="vacHowQuick"></a>
            <h4>I'm leaving for my trip in a few days. Can 
			I still get the Hepatitis A vaccine?</h4>
		<p>Experts now say that the first dose of Hepatitis A vaccine can be given 
		at any time before departure. This will provide some protection for most 
		healthy persons.</p>
		
			<a name="vacProtect"></a>
            <h4>Will the Hepatitis A vaccine protect someone 
			from other forms of hepatitis?</h4>
		<p>Hepatitis A vaccine will only protect someone from Hepatitis A. A separate 
		vaccine is available for Hepatitis B. There is also a combination vaccine 
		that protects a person from Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B. No vaccine is available 
		for Hepatitis C at this time.</p>
		
			<a name="vacImmuno"></a>
            <h4>Can Hepatitis A vaccine be given to immunocompromised 
			persons, such as hemodialysis patients or persons with AIDS?</h4>
		<p>Yes. Because Hepatitis A vaccine is inactivated (not âliveâ), it can 
		be given to people with compromised immune systems.</p>
		
			<a name="vacExtraDose"></a>
            <h4>Is it harmful to have an extra dose of Hepatitis 
			A vaccine or to repeat the entire Hepatitis A vaccine series?</h4>
		<p>No, getting extra doses of Hepatitis A vaccine is not harmful.</p>
		<h4>
			<a name="vacExtraDose"></a>What should be done if the last dose of Hepatitis 
			A vaccine is delayed?</h4>
		<p>The second or last dose should be given by a health professional as soon 
		as possible. The first dose does not need to be given again.</p>
		
			<a name="vacWhere"></a>
            <h4>Where can I get the Hepatitis A vaccine?</h4>
		<p>Speak with your health professional or call your local public health department, may offer free or low-cost vaccines for adults.  For children, check out  		<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/parents/default.htm">
