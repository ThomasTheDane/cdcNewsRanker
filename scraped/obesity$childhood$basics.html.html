It is calculated using a child's weight and height. BMI does not measure body fat directly, but it is a reasonable indicator of body fatness for most children and teens.</p><p>A child's weight status is determined using an age- and sex-specific percentile for BMI rather than the BMI categories used for adults because children's body composition varies as they age and varies between boys and girls.</p><p><a href="/growthcharts/cdc_charts.htm">CDC Growth Charts</a> are used to determine the corresponding BMI-for-age and sex percentile. For children and adolescents (aged 2â19 years):</p><ul><li><strong>Overweight</strong> is defined as a BMI at or above the 85th percentile and lower than the 95th percentile for children of the same age and sex.<sup>1</sup></li><li><strong>Obesity</strong> is defined as a BMI at or above the 95th percentile for children of the same age and sex.<sup>1</sup></li></ul><h2>What are the consequences of childhood obesity?</h2><h3>Health risks now</h3><ul><li>Childhood obesity can have a harmful effect on the body in a variety of ways. Obese children are more likely to haveâ <ul><li>High blood pressure and high cholesterol, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). In one study, 70% of obese children had at least one CVD risk factor, and 39% had two or more.<sup>2</sup></li><li>Increased risk of impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.<sup>3</sup></li><li>Breathing problems, such as sleep apnea, and asthma.<sup>4,5</sup></li><li>Joint problems and musculoskeletal discomfort.<sup>4,6</sup></li><li>Fatty liver disease, gallstones, and gastro-esophageal reflux (i.e., heartburn).<sup>3,4</sup></li><li>Obese children and adolescents have a greater risk of social and psychological problems, such as discrimination and poor self-esteem, which can continue into adulthood.<sup>3,7,8</sup></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Health risks later</h3><ul><li>Obese children are more likely to become obese adults.<sup>9, 10, 11</sup> Adult obesity is associated with a number of serious health conditions including heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers.<sup>12</sup></li><li>If children are overweight, obesity in adulthood is likely to be more severe.<sup>13</sup></li></ul><p><strong><br/>References</strong></p><ol><li>Barlow SE and the Expert Committee.
