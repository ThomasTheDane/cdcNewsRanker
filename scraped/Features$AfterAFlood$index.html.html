Do not put these devices outside near an open door, window, or air vent. You could be poisoned or killed by carbon monoxide, an odorless, colorless gas from burning fuel such as gasoline, charcoal, or propane. Make sure a battery or electric powered CO detector is functional to alert you to dangerous levels of carbon monoxide in your home.</p><p>See also <a href="http://www.emergency.cdc.gov/disasters/poweroutage/needtoknow.asp">What You Need to Know When the Power Goes Out Unexpectedly</a>.</p><h3><img alt="Photo: Filling a glass with tap water." class="imageRighty" height="185" src="/features/afteraflood/afteraflood_a155px.jpg" width="155"/><a id="clean3" name="water"><!-- --></a>Keep Drinking Water and Food Safe</h3><ul><li>Listen to public announcements to find out if local tap water is safe for drinking, cooking, cleaning, or bathing.
