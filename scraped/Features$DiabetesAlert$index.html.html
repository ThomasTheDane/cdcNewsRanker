Take the opportunity to learn your risk for the disease, and how you can prevent type 2 diabetes and its complications.</p></div></div></div><div class="b"><div><!-- --></div></div></div>    		</div></div><!-- END SIDE BOX --><p>Taking a short quiz to check your risk of developing type 2 diabetes is one way you can take the first step to prevent diabetes. CDCâs quiz, at right, asks you about circumstances that can predict whether you are more likely than others to develop the disease. The quiz is called the prediabetes screening test, because it checks whether you are likely to have a condition called prediabetes, which often leads to type 2 diabetes within a few years.</p><p>If you have prediabetes, your blood sugar (glucose) is higher than normal, but not high enough to be considered diabetes. Prediabetes is a wake-up call that type 2 diabetes could be in your future, but you can still prevent it. Research shows that people with prediabetes can greatly reduce the chance they will develop type 2 diabetes by losing some weight and getting more active.</p></div></div>
<div class="syndicate"><div class="mSyndicate"><p>People with prediabetes also are at higher risk for heart disease, stroke and eye disease. Diabetes can cause serious health complications including heart disease, blindness, kidney failure, and the loss of feet or legs. Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States.</p><p>Knowing your risk lets you take charge of your health by making lifestyle changes, such as staying physically active and eating nutritious foods. If the CDC screening quiz shows you have a high risk for prediabetes, talk to your health care provider about getting tested and making changes to eat more healthfully and add more physical activity to your routine.</p><h3>Are You at Risk for Type 2 Diabetes?</h3><p>Almost everyone who develops type 2 diabetes has prediabetes first. You are at higher risk for type 2 diabetes if you are:</p><ul><li>Obese</li><li>Have a parent, brother or sister with type 2 diabetes</li><li>Age 45 or older</li><li>Developed diabetes while pregnant (gestational diabetes)</li><li>Are not physically active</li><li>Belong to certain racial or ethnic groups. African Americans, Hispanic/Latino, American Indians, and some Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are at particularly high risk for type 2 diabetes.</li></ul><p><img alt="Photo: An American Indian" class="imageRighty" height="200" src="/features/diabetesalert/diabetesalert_a200px.jpg" width="150"/>The lifetime risk of diabetes for people born in the United States in 2000 is:</p><ul><li>For all Americans: 1 of 3</li><li>For African American and Hispanic males: 2 of 5</li><li>For African American and Hispanic females: 1 of 2</li></ul><p>Additionally, CDC estimates that as many as 1 in 3 U.S. adults could have diabetes by 2050 if current trends continue. One in 9 U.S. adults has diabetes now.</p><h3>How Can You Prevent Type 2 Diabetes?</h3><p>Even if you have prediabetes, you can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes by changing some habits, studies have shown. You can do it by losing 5 to 7 percent of your body weight if you are overweight â that's just 10 to 14 pounds for a 200-pound person â and being physically active.</p><!-- #### START SIDE BOX #### --><div class="righty sideBox33r"><div class="rx-row">
