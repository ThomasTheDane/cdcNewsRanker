Although the percentage of American adults who smoke has decreased since 2005, nearly one in five adults smoke, and large disparities continue to exist.</p></div><!-- END BANNER SECTION --><!-- CONTENT --><div class="subColumns"><p>A new edition of <em>CDC Vital Signs</em> reports that adult smoking rates in the United States declined overall during 2005â2010; however, the amount and direction of change in smoking prevalence has not been consistent year to year.</p><p><img alt="Photo: Two women talking over coffee." class="imageRighty" height="214" src="/features/vitalsigns/adultsmoking/adultsmoking_a200px.jpg" width="200"/>Key findings also indicate thatâ</p><ul><li>In 2010, nearly one in five U.S. adults (45.3 million) were current cigarette smokers.</li><li>During 2005â2010, patterns of consumption shifted toward smokers consuming fewer cigarettes per day.</li><li>Large disparities in smoking prevalence continue to exist.</li></ul><h2>Who Smokes?</h2><p><em>CDC Vital Signs</em> reveals that among all adults, smoking declined from 20.9% in 2005 to 19.3% in 2010. The percentage of adult daily smokers who smoke 30 or more cigarettes per day also decreased from 13% in 2005 to 8% in 2010, while the percentage of daily smokers who smoke 1 to 9 cigarettes per day increased from 16% to 22%.</p><p>However, cigarette smoking among adults remains widespread. About 45.3 million American adults still smoke, and smoking prevalence varies substantially across population subgroups. Smoking rates are higher amongâ</p><ul><li>Men</li><li>People living below the poverty level</li><li>American Indians and Alaskan Natives</li><li>People with less education</li><li>People living in the Midwest and in the South</li></ul><h2>What Does This Mean?</h2><p><img alt="Photo: Father and son talking." class="imageRighty" height="169" src="/features/vitalsigns/adultsmoking/adultsmoking_b200px.jpg" width="200"/>Tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of disease, death, and disability in the United States. Of the 19.3% of American adults who smoke, about half will die prematurely from smoking-related causes. Despite an overall decrease in the prevalence of cigarette smoking during 2005â2010, the <em>Healthy People 2020</em> goal of achieving an overall adult smoking rate of 12% or less will not be achieved if current trends continue.</p><p>Some people who smoke every day are smoking fewer cigarettes. However, even occasional smoking causes harm, and the best option for any smoker is to quit completely.</p><h2>What Can Be Done?</h2><p>Reducing tobacco use is a winnable battle. There are effective strategies known to be successful in addressing this public health priority. <em>CDC Vital Signs</em> stresses the importance of more fully implementing these proven strategies to reduce cigarette smoking and encourage cessation.</p><ul><li>Implement 100% smoke-free laws in workplaces and public places;</li><li>Increase the price of tobacco products;</li><li>Use graphic warning labels and hard-hitting mass media campaigns to warn about the dangers of tobacco use;</li><li>Enforce restrictions on tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorships; and</li><li>Expand access to affordable, effective cessation treatment.</li></ul><h2>Call to Action</h2><p><img alt="Sign: This is a smoke-free building." class="imageRighty" height="154" src="/features/vitalsigns/adultsmoking/adultsmoking_c200px.jpg" width="200"/>The tobacco-related issue of <em>CDC Vital Signs</em> includes direct calls to action forâ</p><ul><li><strong>Tobacco users</strong> to make their homes and vehicles smoke-free and to quit at any age.
