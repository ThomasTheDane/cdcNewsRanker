      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Children and adults with viral infections, which antibiotics cannot treat, usually recover when the illness has run its course. Colds, a type of viral infection, can last for up to two weeks. You should keep your healthcare provider informed if your or your childâs illness gets worse or lasts longer than expected. Over-the-counter medicines may help relieve some symptoms.</p>

      <p>For adults, over-the-counter pain relievers, decongestants and saline nasal sprays may help relieve some symptoms. Remember, always use over-the-counter products as directed.</p>
      <p>For children, over-the-counter pain relievers, decongestants and saline nasal sprays may help relieve some symptoms. Not all products are recommended for children of certain ages.</p>

      <h4 class="faqs-q"><span class="qa-color">Q:</span> What pain relievers can I give my child?</h4>
      <p class="blockquote"><span class="qa-color">A:</span>  For babies 6 months of age or younger, parents should only give acetaminophen for pain relief. For a child 6 months of age or older, either acetaminophen or ibuprofen can be given for pain relief. Be sure to ask your childâs healthcare provider for the right dosage for your childâs age and size. Do not give aspirin to your child because of Reye's syndrome, a rare but very serious illness that harms the liver and brain. Learn more about <a href="http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/reyes_syndrome/reyes_syndrome.htm">Reyeâs syndrome</a>.</p>
      <h4 class="faqs-q"><span class="qa-color">Q:</span> Should parents give cough and cold medicines to young children?</h4>
      <p class="blockquote"><span class="qa-color">A:</span> The Consumer Healthcare Products Association (CHPA), a group that represents most of the makers of nonprescription over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medicines, recommends that these products not be used in children under 4 years of age. <a href="http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm048515.htm">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</a> supports this recommendation. Overuse and misuse of OTC cough and cold medicines in young children can result in serious and potentially life-threatening side effects.</p>
      <h4 class="faqs-q"><span class="qa-color">Q:</span> What can parents do to help their children feel better if they are too young to take cough and cold medicines or the healthcare provider advises against using them?</h4>
      <p class="blockquote"><span class="qa-color">A:</span> Parents might consider clearing nasal congestion in infants with a rubber suction bulb. Also, a stuffy nose can be relieved with saline nose drops or a clean humidified or cool-mist vaporizer.</p>
      <h4 class="faqs-q"><span class="qa-color">Q:</span> Should parents give cough and cold medicines to children over 4 years of age?</h4>
      <p class="blockquote"><span class="qa-color">A:</span> Cough and cold symptoms usually go away without treatment after a certain amount of time. Over-the-counter cough and cold medicines will not cure the common cold, but may give some temporary relief of symptoms. Parents should consult their childâs healthcare provider if they have any concerns or questions about giving their child a medication. Parents should always tell their childâs healthcare provider about all prescription and over-the-counter medicines they are giving their child.</p>
      <h4 class="faqs-q"><span class="qa-color">Q:</span> What should parents and doctors be careful of if they want to give cough and cold medicines to children over 4 years of age?</h4>
      <p class="blockquote"><span class="qa-color">A:</span> Always keep medications in original bottles or containers, with the cap secure, and up and away from children. Children getting into and taking medications without adult supervision can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening effects. Avoid giving more than one cough and cold medicine at a time to children. Two medicines may have different brand names but may contain the same ingredient. Some cough and cold medicines contain more than one active ingredient. Also, follow directions carefully to avoid giving too much medication; the right amount of medication often depends on your childâs age and weight.</p>
