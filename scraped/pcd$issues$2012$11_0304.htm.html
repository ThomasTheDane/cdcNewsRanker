<h2>To the Editor:</h2>
<p>As public health practitioners from the National Asthma Control Program (NACP) 
of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we read the essay “From 
Evidence-Based Medicine to Evidence-Based Health: the Example of Asthma” (1) 
with great interest. We agree with the authorsâ hypothesis that evidence-based 
clinical medicine must be supplemented by asthma self-management support “that 
extends beyond the clinic” and “by interventions that change elements of the 
environment in which patients live.” As the authors note, this concept is not 
new. Indeed, it underlies the Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the 
Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (2).</p>
<p>A recent article (3) describes remarkable progress not only in understanding 
the pathophysiology of asthma and in producing new medications for its control 
but also in a public health response “to support patient- and community-level 
interventions and to assess the effect of the environment on asthma.” The NACP 
has greatly expanded population-level asthma surveillance of asthma prevalence, 
illness, and death (4). The NACP also supports 34 states, Washington, DC, 
and Puerto Rico “to build and sustain programs that translate evidence-based 
practice into interventions.” Furthermore, the Task Force on Community 
Preventive Services recently conducted and published a systematic review of the 
effectiveness of home-based, multi-trigger, multicomponent interventions in 
improving asthma control (5). The NACP is working through state asthma programs 
to implement those interventions.</p>
<p>Much work remains to be done to achieve evidence-based health (as defined by 
Moskowitz and Bodenheimer), particularly among racial/ethnic minorities, who 
have a disparately high prevalence of and morbidity from asthma. The authors 
note 3 necessary actions: linking clinical teams with community resources to 
address asthma triggers in housing, advocating for better housing and cleaner 
air, and convincing insurers to reimburse for essential educational and 
community health services. We suggest that these actions, although necessary, 
are not sufficient to decrease the burden of asthma at a population level.</p>
<p>Although sufficient evidence exists to direct the clinical management of 
asthma, there is an urgent need to expand the evidence for cost-effective ways 
to implement medical and behavioral interventions on a large scale and among 
diverse settings and communities. Moskowitz and Bodenheimer cite reports of 
successful asthma interventions in several communities. These interventions, 
although key demonstration projects, are the equivalent of clinical case 
studies. Just as experts would not base clinical guidelines on case studies, 
program planners and policy makers should not base decisions about community health 
interventions on a few demonstration projects.</p>
<p>No national system exists to direct program implementation questions back to 
an organized research effort and address them systematically. Both the research 
to determine the most cost-effective strategies for ensuring that evidence-based 
treatments reach the populations most in need and the programs charged with 
implementing those strategies are grossly underfunded. As Steven Woolf argues 
(6), the vastly disproportionate funding of research to develop new treatments 
and procedures over research to deliver existing ones more effectively and 
equitably does not advance the publicâs health; indeed “the current policy of 
spending [only] 1.5% of research dollars on health services research is probably 
costing lives.”</p>
<p>Thus, we agree with Moskowitz and Bodenheimer that implementing evidence-based 
health “is essential to reduce the burden of asthma and other chronic diseases 
and to help control the associated costs to society.” We add, however, that 
implementation is not a matter of “just doing it.” Implementation is a science 
that requires a systematic cycle of hypothesis formation, testing, analysis, 
feedback, and dissemination. It should be valued and funded at a level that 
reflects its potential for improving the publicâs health.</p>
