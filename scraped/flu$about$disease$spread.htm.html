<div class="syndicate"><div class="mSyndicate"><h3>Person to Person</h3><p>People with flu can spread it to others up to about 6 feet away. Most experts think that flu viruses are spread mainly by droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Less often, a person might also get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth or nose.</p><p>To avoid this, people should stay away from sick people and stay home if sick. It also is important to wash hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub. Linens, eating utensils, and dishes belonging to those who are sick should not be shared without washing thoroughly first. Eating utensils can be washed either in a dishwasher or by hand with water and soap and do not need to be cleaned separately. Further, frequently touched surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected at home, work and school, especially if someone is ill.</p><h3>The Flu Is Contagious</h3><p>Most healthy adults may be able to infect other people beginning 1 day <strong>before</strong> symptoms develop and up to 5 to 7 days <strong>after</strong> becoming sick. Children may pass the virus for longer than 7 days. Symptoms start 1 to 4 days after the virus enters the body. <strong>That means that you may be able to pass on the flu to someone else before you know you are sick, as well as while you are sick</strong>. Some people can be infected with the flu virus but have no symptoms. During this time, those persons may still spread the virus to others.</p></div></div>
