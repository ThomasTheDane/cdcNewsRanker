<p>Passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 marks an 
important step toward making health care available to all Americans. However, implementation of the legislation over the next 
decade faces organizational, political, and economic challenges (1). 
One of the surest ways to maximize the chances for health care reform to achieve 
its aims is to reduce the burden of chronic disease on the nation’s health care 
system.</p>
<p>Chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, hypertension, stroke, and 
diabetes now account for 80% of deaths in the United States and 75% of 
health care costs. In 2005, 44% of all Americans had at least 1 chronic 
condition and 13% had 3 or more. By 2020, an estimated 157 million US residents 
will have 1 chronic condition or more (2). Although an aging population has 
contributed to the increase in chronic conditions, children and young adults 
face a growing prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and asthma. Between 1996 and 2005, 
the number of people aged 25 to 44 years with more than 1 chronic disease doubled (2).</p>
<p>Health care reform legislation promises better access to screening and early 
intervention for chronic conditions for vulnerable populations. Similarly, 
advances in understanding the role of the human genome in the expression of 
chronic conditions offers hope for new treatments (3). Unfortunately, evidence 
suggests that innovations in genomic medicine are unlikely to reduce the 
prevalence or costs of chronic conditions in the coming decade (4).</p>
<p>To lower the incidence of chronic diseases and thus the costs they impose on 
our society and health care system will require addressing the deeper causes of 
the increase in recent decades. Much evidence suggests concrete 
action that could help to prevent further increases in chronic diseases. We 
suggest 4 broad strategies.</p>
<p>First, the United States needs to bring its environmental and consumer 
protection regulations into the 21st century. Air pollution, especially in urban 
and low-income areas, contributes to illnesses and deaths from cancer and heart 
and respiratory diseases. In 2002, at least 146 million people in the United 
States lived in areas 
that did not meet at least 1 US Environmental Protection Agency air pollution standard (5). Tobacco 
and alcohol use and 
consumption of foods high in fat, sugar, salt, and calories contribute to a substantial 
proportion 
of chronic disease deaths, yet most of the nation’s regulatory approaches to 
these products were developed in the first half of the 20th century. New forms 
of marketing, product design, and retail distribution make these old approaches 
insufficient to protect the population against the aggressive promotion of these 
unhealthful products. In the last 3 decades, the tobacco, alcohol, and food 
industries have substantially increased their efforts to oppose public health 
protection against these products and to persuade consumers to 
use their products  
(6). Developing stronger national, state, and local protections and finding new 
ways to prevent these industries from externalizing their costs onto taxpayers 
can contribute to reducing the behaviors that put people at risk for chronic 
diseases (7).</p>
<p>Second, the nation needs to maintain and strengthen federal, state, and local 
public health infrastructure. In 2004, Frieden charged local public health 
officials in the United States with being “asleep at the switch” in their response 
to the growing threats from chronic disease (8). He urged stronger surveillance 
programs, environmental interventions, new regulation, and more funding. In the 
past 2 years, however, as a result of the economic crisis, many state and local 
health departments have cut funding for services, including chronic disease 
control (9). This action jeopardizes prevention of chronic diseases by increasing the 
flow of people with chronic illnesses into the health care system, making it 
more difficult for health reform to achieve its objectives.</p>
<p>Third, the country needs to offer new incentives to create a built 
environment that promotes health. Increased physical activity protects against 
several chronic conditions, yet urban, suburban, and rural environments often make 
it difficult to walk, bicycle, or use other forms of active transport. 
Government can help people make more healthful choices the default choice by 
modifying zoning rules; developing transportation systems that encourage active 
transport; and designing schools, workplaces, and communities that promote 
physical activity and discourage being sedentary.</p>
<p>Finally, the nation’s health care system needs to modify its practices to 
make prevention of chronic diseases a priority. This modification could be achieved by 
extending the reach of evidence-based intervention programs; strengthening 
community health centers; increasing reimbursement for services such as tobacco 
use cessation, nutrition, and alcohol counseling; and providing health 
professionals with additional prevention skills (10-12).</p>
<p>These 4 strategies offer several advantages. They rely on off-the-shelf 
science, reducing the necessity of additional years of research before 
implementation. Each contributes to improvements in various chronic conditions. 
The proposed measures can contribute to reductions in cancer, diabetes, 
hypertension, and heart disease <a name="table1_up"></a>(<a href="#table1_down">Table</a>), each projected to increase in 
prevalence by more than 40% in the next 2 decades (10). In addition, these 
strategies reduce population incidence of chronic conditions and help shrink 
disparities because the targeted conditions mostly affect low-income, black, and 
Latino populations.</p>
	<p>Updating environmental and consumer protection, 
strengthening the public health infrastructure, improving the built environment 
that influences health, and making prevention a priority for our health care 
system have the potential to win broad voter and policy maker support. Although 
any policy reforms that threaten the status quo will be opposed by some special 
interests, these recommendations will benefit most people in the United States, save taxpayer 
dollars, and help the nation to achieve its health goals. Implementing the 4 
simultaneously will help to achieve synergies that can accelerate and magnify 
their effect. By providing the leadership needed to realize these changes, 
health professionals can increase the likelihood that health care reform will 
succeed and that the nation’s health will improve.</p>
