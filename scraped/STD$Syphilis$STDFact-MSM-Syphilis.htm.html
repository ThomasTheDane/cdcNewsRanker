            <a id="WhatIs"></a><h3>What is syphilis?</h3>
            <p><a class="disableHyperlinkMobile" href="default.htm">Syphilis</a> is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by the bacterium <em>Treponema pallidum</em>. It has often been called "the great imitator" because so many of the signs and symptoms are indistinguishable from those of other diseases.</p>
            <p class="topOPage" style="display:none;"><a class="mobileBackToTop" href="#">Back to Top</a></p>
            <a id="common"></a><h3>How common is syphilis?</h3>
            <p>In the  United States, health officials reported 49,903 cases of syphilis in 2012,  including 15,667 cases of primary and secondary (P&amp;S) syphilis. In 2012,  half of all P&amp;S syphilis cases were reported from 26 counties and 2 cities.  The incidence of P&amp;S syphilis was highest in women 20 to 24 years of age  and in men 20 to 24 years of age. Reported cases of congenital syphilis in  newborns decreased from 2011 to 2012, with 360 new cases reported in 2011  compared to 322 cases in 2012.</p>
            <p>Between  2011 and 2012, the number of reported P&amp;S syphilis cases increased 12.1  percent. In 2012, 75% of the reported P&amp;S syphilis cases were among men who  have sex with men (MSM).</p>

            <a id="Howspread"></a><h3>How do people get syphilis?</h3>
            <p>Syphilis is passed from person to person through direct contact
              with a syphilis sore. Sores occur mainly on the external genitals,
              vagina, anus, or in the rectum. Sores also can occur on the lips
              and in the mouth. Transmission of the organism occurs during vaginal,
              anal, or oral sex. <a class="disableHyperlinkMobile" href="../pregnancy/STDfact-Pregnancy.htm">Pregnant
              women</a> with the disease can pass it to the babies they are carrying.
              Syphilis cannot be spread through contact with toilet seats, doorknobs,
              swimming pools, hot tubs, bathtubs, shared clothing, or eating utensils.</p>
              <p class="topOPage" style="display:none;"><a class="mobileBackToTop" href="#">Back to Top</a></p>
            <a id="signs"></a><h3>What are the signs and symptoms in adults?</h3>
            <p>Many people infected with syphilis do not have any symptoms for
              years, yet remain at risk for late complications if they are not
              treated. Although transmission occurs from persons with sores who
              are in the primary or secondary stage, many of these sores are unrecognized.
              Thus, transmission may occur from persons who are unaware of their
              infection.</p>
            <p><strong>Primary Stage</strong><br/>
              The primary stage of syphilis is usually marked by the appearance
              of a single sore (called a chancre), but there may be multiple sores.
              The time between infection with syphilis and the start of the first
              symptom can range from 10 to 90 days (average 21 days). The chancre
              is usually firm, round, small, and painless. It appears at the spot
              where syphilis entered the body. The chancre lasts 3 to 6 weeks, and
              it heals without treatment. However, if adequate treatment is not administered,
              the infection progresses to the secondary stage.</p>
            <p><strong>Secondary Stage</strong><br/>
              Skin rash and mucous membrane lesions characterize the secondary
              stage. This stage typically starts with the development of a rash
              on one or more areas of the body. The rash usually does not cause
              itching. Rashes associated with secondary syphilis can appear as
              the chancre is healing or several weeks after the chancre has healed.
              The characteristic rash of secondary syphilis may appear as rough,
              red, or reddish brown spots both on the palms of the hands and the
              bottoms of the feet. However, rashes with a different appearance
              may occur on other parts of the body, sometimes resembling rashes
              caused by other diseases. Sometimes rashes associated with secondary
              syphilis are so faint that they are not noticed. In addition to rashes,
              symptoms of secondary syphilis may include fever, swollen lymph glands,
              sore throat, patchy hair loss, headaches, weight loss, muscle aches,
              and fatigue. The signs and symptoms of secondary syphilis will resolve
              with or without treatment, but without treatment, the infection will
              progress to the latent and possibly late stages of disease.</p>
            <p><strong>Latent and Late Stages</strong><br/>
              The latent (hidden) stage of syphilis begins when primary and secondary
              symptoms disappear. Without treatment, the infected person will continue
              to have syphilis even though there are no signs or symptoms; infection
              remains in the body.   This latent stage can last for years.   The
              late stages of syphilis can develop in about 15% of people who have
              not been treated for syphilis, and can appear 10-20 years after infection
              was first acquired.  In the late stages of syphilis, the disease
              may damage the internal organs, including the brain, nerves, eyes,
              heart, blood vessels, liver, bones, and joints. Signs and symptoms
              of the late stage of syphilis include difficulty coordinating muscle
              movements, paralysis, numbness, gradual blindness, and dementia.
              This damage may be serious enough to cause death.</p>

            <a id="concern"></a><h3>Why should MSM be concerned about syphilis?</h3>
            <p>Over the past several years, increases in syphilis among MSM have
              been reported in various cities and areas, including Chicago, Seattle,
              San Francisco, Southern California, Miami, and New York City. In
              the recent outbreaks, high rates of <a class="disableHyperlinkMobile" href="/std/HIV/default.htm">HIV</a> co-infection were documented, ranging from 20 percent to 70 percent. While the
              health problems caused by syphilis in adults are serious in their
              own right, it is now known that <a class="disableHyperlinkMobile" href="/std/HIV/default.htm">the
              genital sores caused by syphilis in adults also make it easier to
              transmit and acquire HIV infection sexually</a>.</p>
              <p class="topOPage" style="display:none;"><a class="mobileBackToTop" href="#">Back to Top</a></p>
            <a id="diagnosed"></a><h3>How is syphilis diagnosed?</h3>
            <p>Some health care providers can diagnose syphilis by examining material
              from a chancre (infectious sore) using a special microscope called
              a dark-field microscope. If syphilis bacteria are present in the
              sore, they will show up when observed through the microscope. </p>
            <p>A blood test is another way to determine whether someone has syphilis.
              Shortly after infection occurs, the body produces syphilis antibodies
              that can be detected by an accurate, safe, and inexpensive blood test.
              A low level of antibodies will likely stay in the blood for months
              or years even after the disease has been successfully treated.</p>

<div class="syndicate"><div class="mSyndicate"> 
            <a id="hivlink"></a><h3>What is the link between syphilis and HIV?</h3>
            <p>Genital sores (chancres) caused by syphilis make it easier to transmit
              and acquire <a class="disableHyperlinkMobile" href="/std/HIV/default.htm">HIV</a> infection
              sexually. There is an estimated 2- to 5-fold increased risk of acquiring
              HIV if exposed to that infection when syphilis is present.</p>
            <p>Ulcerative STDs that cause sores, ulcers, or breaks in the skin or
              mucous membranes, such as syphilis, disrupt barriers that provide
              protection against infections. The genital ulcers caused by syphilis
              can bleed easily, and when they come into contact with oral and
              rectal mucosa during sex, increase the infectiousness of and susceptibility
              to HIV. Having other STDs is also an important predictor for becoming
              HIV infected because STDs are a marker for behaviors associated
              with HIV transmission. </p>
              <p class="topOPage" style="display:none;"><a class="mobileBackToTop" href="#">Back to Top</a></p>
            <a id="treatment"></a><h3>What is the treatment for syphilis?</h3>
            <p>Syphilis is easy to cure in its early stages. A single intramuscular
              injection of penicillin, an antibiotic, will cure a person who has
              had syphilis for less than a year. Additional doses are needed to
              treat someone who has had syphilis for longer than a year. For people
              who are allergic to penicillin, other antibiotics are available to
              treat syphilis. There are no home remedies or over-the-counter drugs
              that will cure syphilis. Treatment will kill the syphilis bacterium
              and prevent further damage, but it will not repair damage already
              done.</p>
            <p>Because effective treatment is available, it is important that persons
              be screened for syphilis on an on-going basis if their sexual behaviors
              put them at risk for STDs. </p>
            <p>Persons who receive syphilis treatment must abstain from sexual contact
              with new partners until the syphilis sores are completely healed. Persons
              with syphilis must notify their sex partners so that they also can
              be tested and receive treatment if necessary.</p>
              <p class="topOPage" style="display:none;"><a class="mobileBackToTop" href="#">Back to Top</a></p>
            <a id="recur"></a><h3>Will syphilis recur?</h3>
            <p>Having syphilis once does not protect a person from getting it again.
              Following successful treatment, people can still be susceptible to
              re-infection. Only laboratory tests can confirm whether someone has
              syphilis. Because syphilis sores can be hidden in the vagina, rectum,
              or mouth, it may not be obvious that a sex partner has syphilis.
              Talking with a health care provider will help to determine the need
              to be re-tested for syphilis after being treated.</p>
              <p class="topOPage" style="display:none;"><a class="mobileBackToTop" href="#">Back to Top</a></p>
            <a id="prevent"></a><h3>How can syphilis be prevented?</h3>
            <p>The surest way to avoid transmission of sexually transmitted diseases,
              including syphilis, is to abstain from sexual contact or to be in
              a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has
              been tested and is known to be uninfected. </p>
            <p>Avoiding alcohol and drug use may also help prevent transmission
              of syphilis because these activities may lead to risky sexual behavior.
              It is important that sex partners talk to each other about their
              HIV status and history of other STDs so that preventive action
              can be taken.</p>
            <p>Genital ulcer diseases, like syphilis, can occur in both male and
              female genital areas that are covered or protected by a latex condom,
              as well as in areas that are not covered. Correct and consistent
              use of latex condoms can reduce the risk of syphilis, as well as <a class="disableHyperlinkMobile" href="/std/Herpes/default.htm">genital herpes</a> and chancroid, only when the infected area or site of potential exposure is protected. </p>
            <p>Condoms lubricated with spermicides (especially Nonoxynol-9
              or N-9) are no more effective than other lubricated condoms in protecting
              against the transmission of STDs.  Use of condoms lubricated
              with N-9 is not recommended for STD/HIV prevention.  Transmission
              of an STD, including syphilis cannot be prevented by washing the
              genitals, urinating, and or douching after sex. Any unusual discharge,
              sore, or rash, particularly in the groin area, should be a signal to refrain
              from having sex and to see a doctor immediately.</p>
            <p>The CDCâs <a class="disableHyperlinkMobile" href="/std/treatment/2006/default.htm">2006
              Sexually Transmitted Disease Treatment Guidelines</a> recommend
              that MSM who are at risk for STDs be tested for syphilis annually.</p>
