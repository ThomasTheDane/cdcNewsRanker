For example, some people might like walking in their neighborhood in the mornings; others might prefer an exercise class at a health club after work.</li><li>Try activities with friends or family members to help with motivation and mutual encouragement.</li><li>Start slowly and work your way up to more physically challenging activities.

Monitor your daily activities for one week. Identify at least three 30-minute time slots you could use for physical activity.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td scope="row">I don't have anyone to go with me.</td><td align="left">Develop new friendships with physically active people.
