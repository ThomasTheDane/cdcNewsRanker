Each year in the United States, there are millions of cases of the common cold. Adults have an average of 2-3 colds per year, and children have even more.</p><p>Most people get colds in the winter and spring, but it is possible to get a cold at any time of the year. Symptoms usually include sore throat, runny nose, coughing, sneezing, watery eyes, headaches and body aches. Most people recover within about 7-10 days. However, people with weakened immune systems, asthma, or respiratory conditions may develop serious illness, such as pneumonia.Â </p><div class="c33r"><div class="subc"><div class="module rounders bullet-list"><div class="inner"><div class="t"></div><div class="subColumns"><div class="subc"><h3>Rhinoviruses</h3><ul class="nolines"><li class="flow">cause colds</li><li>trigger asthma attacks</li><li>have been linked to sinus and ear infections</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="b"><div></div></div></div></div></div><!-- END SIDE BOX --><p>Many different viruses can cause the common cold, but rhinoviruses are the most common. Viruses that cause colds can spread from infected people to others through the air and close personal contact. You can also get infected through contact with stool or respiratory secretions from an infected person. This can happen when you shake hands with someone who has a cold, or touch a doorknob that has viruses on it, then touch your eyes, mouth, or nose.</p><h3>How to Protect Yourself and Others</h3><p><img alt="Photo: Father showing young son how to wash hands properly" class="stroke righty" height="166" src="/features/rhinoviruses/rhinoviruses_b200px.jpg" width="200"/>You can help reduce your risk of getting a cold:</p><ul><li><strong>Wash your hands often with soap and water<br/></strong><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/">Scrub them for 20 seconds</a>, and help young children do the same. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

To feel better, you should get lots of rest and drink plenty of fluids. Over-the-counter medicines may help ease symptoms but will not make your cold go away any faster. Always read the label and use medications as directed. Talk to your doctor before giving your child nonprescription cold medicines, since some medicines contain ingredients that are not recommended for children.

They do not work against viruses, and they may make it harder for your body to fight future bacterial infections if you take them unnecessarily.
