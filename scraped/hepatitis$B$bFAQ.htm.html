          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <a name="bFAQ01"></a>
          <h4>What is hepatitis?</h4>
          <p>âHepatitisâ means inflammation of the liver. Toxins, certain drugs, some 
            diseases, heavy alcohol use, and bacterial and viral infections can all 
            cause hepatitis. Hepatitis is also the name of a family of viral infections 
            that affect the <a onclick="
		if (window.showModelessDialog) {
		 win = window.showModalDialog('../TheLiver.htm', window,'status:no;dialogHeight: 220px');
		} else {
		win = window.open('../TheLiver.htm',window);
		}" onfocus="this.blur();" onmouseover='this.style.cursor="pointer" '><span style="text-decoration: underline;">liver</span></a>; the most 
            common types are Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ02"></a>
          <h4>What is the difference between Hepatitis A, Hepatitis 
            B, and Hepatitis C?</h4>
          <p><a class="narrativeLink" href="../A/index.htm">Hepatitis A</a>, <a class="narrativeLink" href="index.htm">Hepatitis B</a>, and <a class="narrativeLink" href="../C/index.htm">Hepatitis C</a> are diseases 
            caused by three different viruses. Although each can cause similar symptoms, 
            they have different modes of transmission and can affect the liver differently. 
            Hepatitis A appears only as an acute or newly occurring infection and does 
            not become chronic. People with Hepatitis A usually improve without treatment. 
            Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C can also begin as acute infections, but in some 
            people, the virus remains in the body, resulting in chronic disease and 
            long-term liver problems. There are vaccines to prevent Hepatitis A and 
            B; however, there is not one for Hepatitis C. If a person has had one type 
            of viral hepatitis in the past, it is still possible to get the other types.</p>
          <p></p>
          <h4> <a name="bFAQ03"></a>What is Hepatitis B?</h4>
          <p>Hepatitis B is a contagious liver disease that ranges in severity from 
            a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. It results 
            from infection with the Hepatitis B virus. Hepatitis B can be either âacuteâ 
            or âchronic.â</p>
          <blockquote> <strong>Acute Hepatitis B virus infection</strong> is a short-term illness 
            that occurs within the first 6 months after someone is exposed to the 
            Hepatitis B virus. Acute infection can â but does not always â lead 
            to chronic infection.
            <p></p>
            <p><strong>Chronic Hepatitis B virus infection</strong> is a long-term 
              illness that occurs when the Hepatitis B virus remains in a personâs 
              body. </p>
            <p>  </p>

          <h2>Statistics</h2>
          <h4> <a name="bFAQ05"></a>How common is acute Hepatitis B in the United States?</h4>
          <p>In 2007, there were an estimated 43,000 new Hepatitis B virus infections 
            in the United States. However, the official number of reported Hepatitis 
            B cases is much lower. Many people donât know they are infected or may not 
            have symptoms and therefore never seek the attention of medical or public 
            health officials.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ06"></a>
          <h4>Has the number of people in the United States with 
            acute Hepatitis B been decreasing?</h4>
          <p>Yes, rates of acute Hepatitis B in the United States have declined by 
            approximately 82% since 1990. At that time, routine Hepatitis B vaccination 
            of children was implemented and has dramatically decreased the rates of 
            the disease in the United States, particularly among children.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ07"></a>
          <h4>How common is chronic Hepatitis B in the United 
            States?</h4>
          <p>In the United States, an estimated 800,000 to 1.4 million persons have 
            chronic Hepatitis B virus infection.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ08"></a>
          <h4>How common is chronic Hepatitis B outside the United 
            States?</h4>
          <p>Globally, chronic Hepatitis B affects approximately 350 million people 
            and contributes to an estimated 620,000 deaths worldwide each year.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <a name="transmission"></a>
          <h2>Transmission / Exposure</h2>
          <a name="bFAQ09"></a>
          <h4>How likely is it that acute Hepatitis B will become 
            chronic?</h4>
          <p>The likelihood depends upon the age at which someone becomes infected. 
            The younger a person is when infected with Hepatitis B virus, the greater 
            his or her chance of developing chronic Hepatitis B. Approximately 90% of 
            infected infants will develop chronic infection. The risk goes down as a 
            child gets older. Approximately 25%â50% of children infected between the 
            ages of 1 and 5 years will develop chronic hepatitis. The risk drops to 
            6%â10% when a person is infected over 5 years of age. Worldwide, most people 
            with chronic Hepatitis B were infected at birth or during early childhood.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ10"></a>
          <h4>How is Hepatitis B spread?</h4>
          <p class="bulletListIntro">Hepatitis B is spread when blood, semen, or other 
            body fluid infected with the Hepatitis B virus enters the body of a person 
            who is not infected. People can become infected with the virus during activities 
            such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Birth (spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth)</li>
            <li>Sex with an infected partner</li>
            <li>Sharing needles, syringes, or other drug-injection equipment</li>
            <li>Sharing items such as razors or toothbrushes with an infected person</li>
            <li>Direct contact with the blood or open sores of an infected person </li>
            <li>Exposure to blood from needlesticks or other sharp instruments <br/>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <a name="bFAQ11"></a>
          <h4>Can a person spread Hepatitis B and not know it?</h4>
          <p>Yes. Many people with chronic Hepatitis B virus infection do not know 
            they are infected since they do not feel or look sick. However, they still 
            can spread the virus to others and are at risk of serious health problems 
            themselves.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ12"></a>
          <h4>Can Hepatitis B be spread through sex?</h4>
          <p>Yes. Among adults in the United States, Hepatitis B is most commonly 
            spread through sexual contact and accounts for nearly two-thirds of acute 
            Hepatitis B cases. In fact, Hepatitis B is 50â100 times more infectious 
            than HIV and can be passed through the exchange of body fluids, such as 
            semen, vaginal fluids, and blood.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ12a"></a>
          <h4>Can Hepatitis B be spread through food?</h4>
          <p>Unlike Hepatitis A, it is not spread routinely through food or water. 
            However, there have been instances in which Hepatitis B has been spread 
            to babies when they have received food pre-chewed by an infected person.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ13"></a>
          <h4>What are ways Hepatitis B is not spread? </h4>
          <p>Hepatitis B virus is not spread by sharing eating utensils, breastfeeding, 
            hugging, kissing, holding hands, coughing, or sneezing. </p>
          <a name="bFAQ14"></a>
          <h4>Who is at risk for Hepatitis B?</h4>
          <p class="bulletListIntro">Although anyone can get Hepatitis B, some people 
            are at greater risk, such as those who: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Have sex with an infected person</li>
            <li>Have multiple sex partners </li>
            <li>Have a sexually transmitted disease</li>
            <li>Are men who have sexual contact with other men</li>
            <li>Inject drugs or share needles, syringes, or other drug equipment</li>
            <li>Live with a person who has chronic Hepatitis B</li>

          <h4>If I think I have been exposed to the Hepatitis 
            B virus, what should I do?</h4>
          <p>If you are concerned that you might have been exposed to the Hepatitis 
            B virus, call your health professional or your health department. If a person 
            who has been exposed to Hepatitis B virus gets the Hepatitis B vaccine and/or 
            a shot called âHBIGâ (Hepatitis B immune globulin) within 24 hours, Hepatitis 
            B infection may be prevented.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ29"></a>
          <h4>How long does the Hepatitis B virus survive outside 
            the body?</h4>
          <p>Hepatitis B virus can survive outside the body at least 7 days. During 
            that time, the virus can still cause infection if it enters the body of 
            a person who is not infected.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ30"></a>
          <h4>How should blood spills be cleaned from surfaces 
            to make sure that Hepatitis B virus is gone?</h4>
          <p>All blood spills â including those that have already dried â should be 
            cleaned and disinfected with a mixture of bleach and water (one part household 
            bleach to 10 parts water). Gloves should always be used when cleaning up 
            any blood spills. Even dried blood can present a risk to others.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ27"></a>
          <h4>If I had Hepatitis B in the past, can I get it 
            again?</h4>
          <p>No, once you recover from Hepatitis B, you develop antibodies that protect 
            you from the virus for life. An antibody is a substance found in the blood 
            that the body produces in response to a virus. Antibodies protect the body 
            from disease by attaching to the virus and destroying it. However, some 
            people, especially those infected during early childhood, remain infected 
            for life because they never clear the virus from their bodies.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ28"></a>
          <h4>Can I donate blood, organs, or semen if I have 
            Hepatitis B? </h4>
          <p>No, if you have ever tested positive for the Hepatitis B virus, experts 
            recommend that you not donate blood, organs, or semen because this can put 
            the recipient at great risk for getting hepatitis.</p>

          <h2>Symptoms</h2>
          <a name="bFAQ15"></a>
          <h4>Does acute Hepatitis B cause symptoms?</h4>
          <p>Sometimes. Although a majority of adults develop symptoms from acute 
            Hepatitis B virus infection, many young children do not. Adults and children 
            over the age of 5 years are more likely to have symptoms. Seventy percent 
            of adults will develop symptoms from the infection.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ16"></a>
          <h4>What are the symptoms of acute Hepatitis B?</h4>
          <p class="bulletListIntro">Symptoms of acute Hepatitis B, if they appear, 
            can include:</p>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>Fever</li>
            <li>Fatigue</li>
            <li>Loss of appetite </li>
            <li>Nausea </li>
            <li>Vomiting</li>
            <li>Abdominal pain </li>
            <li>Dark urine </li>
            <li>Clay-colored bowel movements </li>
            <li>Joint pain</li>
            <li>Jaundice (yellow color in the skin or the eyes)</li>
          </ul>
          <a name="bFAQ17"></a>
          <h4>How soon after exposure to Hepatitis B will symptoms 
            appear?</h4>
          <p>On average, symptoms appear 90 days (or 3 months) after exposure, but 
            they can appear any time between 6 weeks and 6 months after exposure.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ18"></a>
          <h4>How long do acute Hepatitis B symptoms last?</h4>
          <p>Symptoms usually last a few weeks, but some people can be ill for as 
            long as 6 months. </p>
          <a name="bFAQ19"></a>
          <h4>Can a person spread Hepatitis B without having 
            symptoms?</h4>
          <p>Yes. Many people with Hepatitis B have no symptoms, but these people 
            can still spread the virus. </p>
          <a name="bFAQ20"></a>
          <h4>What are the symptoms of chronic Hepatitis B?</h4>
          <p>Some people have ongoing symptoms similar to acute Hepatitis B, but most 
            individuals with chronic Hepatitis B remain symptom free for as long as 
            20 or 30 years. About 15%â25% of people with chronic Hepatitis B develop 
            serious liver conditions, such as cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) or liver 
            cancer. Even as the liver becomes diseased, some people still do not have 
            symptoms, although certain blood tests for liver function might begin to 
            show some abnormalities.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ21"></a>
          <h4>How will I know if I have Hepatitis B?</h4>
          <p class="bulletListIntro">Talk to your health professional. Since many 
            people with Hepatitis B do not have symptoms, doctors diagnose the disease 
            by one or more blood tests. These tests look for the presence of antibodies 
            or antigens and can help determine whether you:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>have acute or chronic infection</li>
            <li>have recovered from infection</li>
            <li>are immune to Hepatitis B</li>
            <li>could benefit from vaccination   </li>
          </ul>
          <a name="bFAQ04"></a>
          <h4>How serious is chronic Hepatitis B?</h4>
          <p>Chronic Hepatitis B is a serious disease that can result in long-term 
            health problems, including liver damage, liver failure, liver cancer, or 
            even death. Approximately 2,000â4,000 people die every year from Hepatitis 
            B-related liver disease.</p>

          <h2>Tests</h2>
          <a name="bFAQ22"></a>
          <h4>What are antigens and antibodies?</h4>
          <p>An antigen is a substance on the surface of a virus that causes a person's 
            immune system to recognize and respond to it. When the body is exposed to 
            an antigen, the body views it as foreign material and takes steps to neutralize 
            the antigen by producing antibodies. An antibody is a substance found in 
            the blood that the body produces in response to a virus. Antibodies protect 
            the body from disease by attaching to the virus and destroying it.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ23"></a>
          <h4>What are the common blood tests available to diagnose 
            Hepatitis B?</h4>
          <p>There are many different blood tests available to diagnose Hepatitis 
            B. They can be ordered as an individual test or as a series of tests. Ask 
            your health professional to explain what he or she hopes to learn from the 
            tests and when you will get the results. Below are some of the common tests 
            and their meanings. But remember: only your doctor can interpret your individual 
            test results.</p>

          <h2>Treatment</h2>
          <a name="bFAQ24"></a>
          <h4>How is acute Hepatitis B treated?</h4>
          <p>There is no medication available to treat acute Hepatitis B. During this 
            short-term infection, doctors usually recommend rest, adequate nutrition, 
            and fluids, although some people may need to be hospitalized.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ25"></a>
          <h4>How is chronic Hepatitis B treated?</h4>
          <p>It depends. People with chronic Hepatitis B virus infection should seek 
            the care or consultation of a doctor with experience treating Hepatitis 
            B. This can include some internists or family medicine practitioners, as 
            well as specialists such as infectious disease physicians, gastroenterologists, 
            or hepatologists (liver specialists). People with chronic Hepatitis B should 
            be monitored regularly for signs of liver disease and evaluated for possible 
            treatment. Several medications have been approved for Hepatitis B treatment, 
            and new drugs are in development. However, not every person with chronic 
            Hepatitis B needs to be on medication, and the drugs may cause side effects 
            in some patients.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ26"></a>
          <h4>What can people with chronic Hepatitis B do to 
            take care of their liver? </h4>
          <p>People with chronic Hepatitis B should be monitored regularly by a doctor 
            experienced in caring for people with Hepatitis B. They should avoid alcohol 
            because it can cause additional liver damage. They also should check with 
            a health professional before taking any prescription pills, supplements, 
            or over-the-counter medications, as these can potentially damage the liver. </p>

          <h2>Prevention / Vaccination</h2>
          <a name="bFAQ31"></a>
          <h4>Can Hepatitis B be prevented?</h4>
          <p>Yes. The best way to prevent Hepatitis B is by getting the Hepatitis 
            B vaccine. The Hepatitis B vaccine is safe and effective and is usually 
            given as 3-4 shots over a 6-month period.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ32"></a>
          <h4>What is the Hepatitis B vaccine series?</h4>
          <p>The Hepatitis B vaccine series is a sequence of shots that stimulate 
            a personâs natural immune system to protect against HBV. After the vaccine 
            is given, the body makes antibodies that protect a person against the virus. 
            An antibody is a substance found in the blood that is produced in response 
            to a virus invading the body. These antibodies are then stored in the body 
            and will fight off the infection if a person is exposed to the Hepatitis 
            B virus in the future.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ33"></a>
          <h4>Who should get vaccinated against Hepatitis B?</h4>

          <h4>Is the Hepatitis B vaccine recommended before international 
            travel?</h4>
          <p>The risk for Hepatitis B virus infection in international travelers is 
            generally low, although people traveling to certain countries are at risk. 
            Travelers to <a class="narrativeLink" href="http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-HepB.aspx#363"> regions with moderate or high rates of Hepatitis B</a> should get the Hepatitis 
            B vaccine.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ36"></a>
          <h4>How is the Hepatitis B vaccine series given?</h4>
          <p>The Hepatitis B vaccine is usually given as a series of 3 or 4 shots 
            over a 6-month period.  </p>
          <a name="bFAQ37"></a>
          <h4>Is the Hepatitis B vaccine series effective?</h4>
          <p>Yes, the Hepatitis B vaccine is very effective at preventing Hepatitis 
            B virus infection. After receiving all three doses, Hepatitis B vaccine 
            provides greater than 90% protection to infants, children, and adults immunized 
            before being exposed to the virus.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ38"></a>
          <h4>Is the Hepatitis B vaccine safe?</h4>
          <p>Yes, the Hepatitis B vaccine is safe. Soreness at the injection site 
            is the most common side effect reported. As with any medicine, there are 
            very small risks that a serious problem could occur after getting the vaccine. 
            However, the potential risks associated with Hepatitis B are much greater 
            than the risks the vaccine poses. Since the vaccine became available in 
            1982, more than 100 million people have received Hepatitis B vaccine in 
            the United States and no serious side effects have been reported.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ39"></a>
          <h4>Is it harmful to have an extra dose of Hepatitis 
            B vaccine or to repeat the entire Hepatitis B vaccine series?</h4>
          <p>No, getting extra doses of Hepatitis B vaccine is not harmful. </p>
          <h4> <a name="bFAQ40"></a>What should be done if Hepatitis B vaccine series 
            was not completed?</h4>
          <p>Talk to your health professional to resume the vaccine series as soon 
            as possible.  The series does not need to be restarted.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ41"></a>
          <h4>Who should not receive the Hepatitis B vaccine?</h4>
          <p>The Hepatitis B vaccine is not recommended for people who have had serious 
            allergic reactions to a prior dose of Hepatitis B vaccine or to any part 
            of the vaccine. Also, it not recommended for anyone who is allergic to yeast 
            because yeast is used when making the vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have 
            any severe allergies.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ42"></a>
          <h4>Are booster doses of Hepatitis B vaccine necessary?</h4>
          <p>It depends. A âboosterâ dose of Hepatitis B vaccine is a dose that increases 
            or extends the effectiveness of the vaccine. Booster doses are recommended 
            only for hemodialysis patients and can be considered for other people with 
            a weakened immune system. Booster doses are not recommended for persons 
            with normal immune status who have been fully vaccinated.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ43"></a>
          <h4>Is there a vaccine that will protect me from both 
            Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B?</h4>
          <p>Yes, there is a combination vaccine that protects people from both Hepatitis 
            A and Hepatitis B. The combined Hepatitis A and B vaccine is usually given 
            as three separate doses over a 6-month period.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ44"></a>
          <h4>Can I get the Hepatitis B vaccine at the same time 
            as other vaccines?</h4>
          <p>Yes. Getting two different vaccines at the same time has not been shown 
            to be harmful. </p>
          <a name="bFAQ45"></a>
          <h4>Where can I get the Hepatitis B vaccine?</h4>
          <p>Talk to your doctor or health professional or call your health department. 
            Some clinics offer free or low-cost vaccines.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ47"></a>
          <h4>What is Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG)?</h4>
          <p>Hepatitis B immune globulin is a substance made from human blood samples 
            that contains antibodies against the Hepatitis B virus. It is given as a 
            shot and can provide short-term protection (approximately 3 months) against 
            Hepatitis B.</p>

          <h2>Pregnancy and Hepatitis B</h2>
          <a name="bFAQ48"></a>
          <h4>Are pregnant women tested for Hepatitis B?</h4>
          <p>Yes. When a pregnant woman comes in for prenatal care, she will be given 
            a series of routine blood tests, including one that checks for the presence 
            of Hepatitis B virus infection. This test is important because women infected 
            with this virus can pass Hepatitis B to their babies during birth. But this 
            can be prevented by giving the infant HBIG and the first Hepatitis B vaccine 
            at birth, and then completing the series. </p>
          <a name="bFAQ49"></a>
          <h4>What if a pregnant woman has Hepatitis B?</h4>
          <p>If a pregnant woman has Hepatitis B, she can pass the infection to her 
            baby during birth. But this can be prevented through a series of vaccinations 
            and HBIG for her baby beginning at birth. Without vaccination, babies born 
            to women with Hepatitis B virus infection can develop chronic infection, 
            which can lead to serious health problems. </p>
          <a name="bFAQ50"></a>
          <h4>How does a baby get Hepatitis B?</h4>
          <p>A baby can get Hepatitis B from an infected mother during childbirth. </p>
          <a name="bFAQ51"></a>
          <h4>Can a baby be protected from getting Hepatitis 
            B from his or her mother during birth?</h4>
          <p>Yes, almost all cases of Hepatitis B can be prevented if a baby born 
            to an infected woman receives the necessary shots at the recommended times 
            The infant should receive a shot called Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) 
            and the first dose of Hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth. Two 
            or 3 additional shots of vaccine are needed over the next 1â15 months to 
            help prevent Hepatitis B. The timing and total number of shots will be influenced 
            by several factors, including the type of vaccine and the baby's age and 
            weight. In addition, experts recommend that the baby be tested after completion 
            of the vaccine series to make sure he or she is protected from the disease. 
            To best protect your baby, follow the advice of his or her doctor.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ52"></a>
          <h4>What happens if a baby gets Hepatitis B?</h4>
          <p>Most newborns who become infected with Hepatitis B virus do not have 
            symptoms, but they have a 90% chance of developing chronic Hepatitis B. 
            This can eventually lead to serious health problems, including liver damage, 
            liver cancer, and even death.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ53"></a>
          <h4>Do babies need the Hepatitis B vaccine even if 
            a pregnant woman does not have Hepatitis B?</h4>
          <p>Yes. The Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for all infants.  CDC 
            recommends that the infant get the first shot before leaving the hospital.</p>
          <a name="bFAQ54"></a>
          <h4>Why is the Hepatitis B vaccine recommended for 
            all babies?</h4>
          <p>Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for all babies so that they will be 
            protected from a serious but preventable disease. Babies and young children 
            are at much greater risk for developing a chronic infection if infected, 
            but the vaccine can prevent this. </p>
