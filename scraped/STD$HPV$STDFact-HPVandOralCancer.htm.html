<h2>Human papillomavirus (HPV) and Oropharyngeal Cancer - Fact Sheet</h2>
<h4>Human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause serious health problems, including genital warts and certain cancers. However, in most cases HPV goes away on its own before causing any health problems.</h4></div></div>

<a id="a1"></a><h3>What is genital HPV?</h3>
<p>Genital human papillomavirus (also called HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the U.S. Most types of HPV are not harmful to people. There are more than 40 types of HPV that can infect the genital areas as well as the mouth and throat. Most people who become infected with HPV do not know that they are infected.</p>

<h3>What is oral HPV? </h3>
<p>The same types of HPV that infect the genital  areas can infect the mouth and throat. HPV found in the mouth and throat is  called “oral HPV.”  Some types of oral  HPV (known as “high risk types”) can cause cancers of the head and neck area. Other  types of oral HPV (known as “low risk types”) can cause warts in the mouth or  throat. In most cases, HPV infections of all types go  away before they cause any health problems.</p>

<h3>What head and neck cancers can be caused by HPV? </h3>
</div></div>
<div class="syndicate"><div class="mSyndicate">
<p>HPV can cause cancers in the back of the throat,  most commonly in the base of the tongue and tonsils, in an area known as the  “oropharynx.” These cancers are called “oropharyngeal cancers.”</p>

<h3>How does HPV cause cancer?</h3>
<p>HPV can cause normal cells in infected skin to turn  abnormal. Most of the time, you cannot see or feel these cell changes. In most  cases, the body fights off the HPV infection naturally and infected cells then  go back to normal. But in cases when the body does not fight off this virus,  HPV can cause visible changes and certain types of HPV can cause an  oropharyngeal cancer. Cancer caused by HPV often takes years to develop after  initially getting an HPV infection.  It is unclear if having HPV alone is  sufficient to cause oropharyngeal cancers, or if other factors (such as smoking  or chewing tobacco) interact with HPV to cause these cancers.  More research  is needed to understand all the factors leading to oropharyngeal cancers.</p>

<h3>What are the signs and symptoms of oropharyngeal  cancer?</h3>
<p>Signs and symptoms may include  persistent sore throat, earaches, hoarseness, enlarged lymph nodes, pain when swallowing,  and unexplained weight loss.  Some persons have no signs or symptoms.</p>

<h3>How common is oral HPV? </h3>
<p>Studies in the U.S. have found  that about 7% of people have oral HPV. But only 1% of people have the type of  oral HPV that is found in oropharyngeal cancers (HPV type 16). Oral HPV is  about three times more common in men than in women.</p>

<h3>How common are cancers  of the oropharynx?</h3>
<p>Each year, in the U.S., about 8,400 people are  diagnosed with cancers of the oropharynx that may be caused by HPV. Cancers of  the oropharynx are about three times more common in men than women.  </p>

<h3>How do people get oral HPV?  </h3>
<p>Only  a few studies have looked at how people get oral HPV, and some of these studies  show conflicting results. Some studies suggest that oral HPV may be passed on  during oral sex (from mouth-to-genital or mouth-to-anus contact) or  open-mouthed (“French”) kissing, others have not.   The likelihood of getting HPV from kissing  or having oral sex with someone who has HPV is not known. We do know that partners  who have been together a long time tend to share genital HPV—meaning they both  may have it.  More research is needed to  understand exactly how people get and give oral HPV infections.</p>

<h3>How can I lower my risk of giving or getting  oral HPV?</h3>
<p>At this time no studies have explored how oral  HPV can be prevented. However, it is likely that condoms and dental dams, when  used consistently and correctly, will lower the chances of giving or getting  oral HPV during oral sex, since they serve as barriers, and can stop the transmission  of HPV from person to person. More research is needed to understand how oral  HPV is passed on, how it can be prevented, and who is most likely to develop health  problems from an oral HPV infection. </p>

<h3>Is there a test for me to find out if I have oral  HPV?  </h3>
<p>There is no FDA-approved test to diagnose  HPV in the mouth or throat.  Medical and dental organizations do not  recommend screening for oral HPV. More  research is needed to find out if screening for oropharyngeal cancers will have  health benefits. Talk to your dentist about any symptoms that could suggest  early signs of oropharyngeal cancer. </p>

<h3>Can HPV vaccines prevent oral HPV and  oropharyngeal cancers?  </h3>
<p>HPV vaccines that are now on the market were developed to prevent cervical and other less common genital cancers. It is possible that HPV vaccines might also prevent oropharyngeal cancers, since the vaccines prevent an initial infection with HPV types that can cause oropharyngeal cancers, but studies have not yet been done to determine if HPV vaccines will prevent oropharyngeal cancers. </p>
