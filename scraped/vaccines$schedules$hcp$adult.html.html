    Each year, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) reviews the recommended adult immunization schedule for anyone over 18 years old to ensure that the adult schedule reflects current recommendations for licensed vaccines. In October 2013, ACIP approved the adult recommended immunization schedule for 2014. The 2014 recommended immunization schedule is effective February 1, 2014; the MMWR publication date is February 7, 2014.</p>
   <br/>
  
   <h2 class="special_hdr"><a name="chgs"></a>Changes in the Schedule Since Last Version</h2>
    
    <p>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) annually reviews the recommended Adult Immunization Schedule to ensure that the schedule reflects current recommendations for the licensed vaccines. The primary changes include: </p>
    <h4>Figure Changes</h4>
    	<p>For Figures 1 and 2, a row for Hib vaccine was added and the PCV13 vaccine row was moved before PPSV23 as a reminder that PCV13 vaccines should be administered first among patients for whom both vaccines are recommended.</p>
    <h4>Footnote Changes</h4>
    		<p>The Hib vaccine recommendations were updated. The vaccine is recommended for certain adults at increased risk for Hib who have not received the vaccine before. Adults who have had a successful hematopoietic stem cell transplant are recommended to receive a 3-dose series of Hib vaccine 6 to 12 months after the transplant regardless of prior Hib vaccination status. Prior Hib vaccine guidance recommended that Hib vaccination of persons infected with HIV be considered, but updated guidance no longer recommends Hib vaccination of previously unvaccinated adults with HIV infection because their risk for Hib infection is low.</p>
            <p>Information on the RIV and the use of RIV and IIV among egg-allergic patients was added to the footnote and indicates that RIV or IIV can be used among persons with hives-only allergy to eggs. The RIV contains no egg protein and can be used among persons aged 18 to 49 years who have egg allergy of any severity.</p>
            <p>The Td/Tdap vaccine footnote was edited to harmonize with the language used in the pediatric immunization schedule. A single dose of Tdap vaccine is recommended for previously unvaccinated persons aged 11 years or older, and Td booster should be administered every 10 years thereafter. Pregnant women continue to be recommended to receive a dose of Tdap vaccine during each pregnancy, preferably during 27 to 36 weeksâ gestation, regardless of the interval since the prior dose of Tdap or Td vaccination. Information was added to the HPV vaccine footnote to clarify the timing between the second and third doses and to harmonize language between the pediatric and adult immunization schedules; no changes in recommendations were made.</p>
            <p>Both the HPV vaccine footnote and the zoster footnote were simplified, with removal of the bullet regarding health care personnel (HCP). Being a health care worker is not a specific indication for these vaccines, but they should be given to HCP and others who meet age and other indications for these vaccines. Information on HCP vaccination for all vaccines can be found in the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6007a1.htm"><em>MMWR</em> âImmunization of Health-Care Personnel</a>â. </p>
            <p>Because PCV13 is recommended to be administered before PPSV23 among persons for whom both vaccines are recommended, the PCV13 footnote now precedes the PPSV23 footnote and includes wording to remind providers of the appropriate order of these vaccines when both are indicated.</p>
            <p>The meningococcal vaccine footnote was edited to clarify which persons need either 1 or 2 doses of vaccine and to provide greater clarity regarding which patients should receive the meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY) versus the meningococcal polysaccharide (MPSV4) quadrivalent vaccines.</p>
            <p>No changes or minor clarifications were made to the footnotes for the MMR, hepatitis A, or hepatitis B vaccines; no changes in recommendations were made.</p>
            
            
            
            
            
<h4>Contraindications Table Changes</h4>
    <ul>
    	<li>The contraindications and precautions table was updated to include information on RIV, an influenza vaccine that contains no egg protein and is indicated for persons aged 18 to 49 years.</li>
        <li>The Hib vaccine was added to the table.</li>
    </ul>
