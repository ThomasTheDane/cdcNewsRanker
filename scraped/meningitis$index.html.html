<div class="syndicate">
                  <p>Meningitis is a disease caused by the inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord known as the meninges. The inflammation is usually caused by an infection of the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord.</p>
                  <p>Meningitis may develop in response to a number of causes, usually bacteria or viruses, but  meningitis can also be caused by physical injury, cancer or certain drugs.</p>
                  <p>The severity of illness and the treatment for meningitis differ depending on the  cause. Thus, it is important to know the specific cause of meningitis.</p>

                              <p>Having meningitis doesn't always mean you have meningococcal disease. And  having meningococcal disease doesnât necessarily mean you have  meningitis. Meningococcal disease is any infection caused by the bacterium <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em>,  or meningococcus. Any infection caused by that bacteria is known as  meningococcal disease. One serious infection it can cause is meningococcal  meningitis. <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/index.html">More about meningococcal disease...</a></p>
