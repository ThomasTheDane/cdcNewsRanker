Use CDC resources to help increase awareness about sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).</p></div><div class="subColumns"><p>Every year, the public health and medical communities recognize April as STD Awareness Month. This month-long observance provides individuals, doctors, and community-based organizations the perfect opportunity to address ways to prevent some of nearly 20 million new sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) that occur in the United States each year. While most of these infections will not cause harm, some have the potential to lead to serious health problems, if not diagnosed and treated early.</p><p>A <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats/STI-Estimates-Fact-Sheet-Feb-2013.pdf">new CDC analysis [PDF - 1.57MB]</a> shows that half of all new infections occur among young people aged 15â24. The analysis goes on to show that STDs cost the American healthcare system nearly $16 billion in direct medical costs, placing both a significant human and economic burden on the United States. Stigma, inconsistent or incorrect condom use, limited access to health care, and a combination of other factors contribute to high rates of STDs among teens and young adults. Despite this concerning news, it is important to know that most STDs are treatable, and many are curable.</p><p><img alt="Photo: A smiling woman." class="stroke righty" height="251" src="/features/stdawareness/stdawareness_b200px.jpg" width="200"/>During the month of April, think about any changes you might make in your life or within your community to raise STD awareness, to reduce stigma, promote prevention, and improve access to care.
