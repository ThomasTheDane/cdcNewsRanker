<h3><a id="what_is" name="what_is"></a>What Is Diabetes?</h3>
 
<p>Diabetes is a group of diseases in which blood sugar levels are higher than normal. Most of the food a person eats is turned into glucose (a kind of sugar) for the bodyâs cells to use for energy. The pancreas, an organ near the stomach, makes a hormone called insulin that helps glucose get into the bodyâs cells. When you have diabetes, your body either doesn't make enough insulin or can't use the insulin very well.  Less glucose gets into the cells and instead builds up in the blood.<sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup> 

</p>
 
<p>There are different types of diabetes. Type 2 is the most common in adults and accounts for more than 90% of all diabetes cases. Fewer people have type 1 diabetes, which most often develops in children, adolescents, or young adults.<sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup>

<h3><a id="how_related" name="how_related"></a>How Is Smoking Related to Diabetes?</h3>
<p>We now know that smoking causes type 2 diabetes. In fact, smokers are 30â40% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than nonsmokers. And people with diabetes who smoke are more likely than nonsmokers to have trouble with insulin dosing and with controlling their disease.<sup><a href="#three">3</a></sup> 

</p><p>The more cigarettes you smoke, the higher your risk for type 2 diabetes.<sup><a href="three">3</a></sup> No matter what  type of diabetes you have, smoking makes your diabetes harder to control.</p>

<p>If you have diabetes and you smoke, you are  more likely to have serious health problems from diabetes. Smokers with  diabetes have higher risks for serious complications, including:<sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>Heart and kidney disease</li>
  <li>Poor blood flow in the legs and feet  that can lead to infections, ulcers, and possible amputation (removal of a  body part by surgery, such as toes or feet)</li>
  <li>Retinopathy (an eye disease that can  cause blindness)</li>
  <li>Peripheral neuropathy (damaged nerves to  the arms and legs that causes numbness, pain, weakness, and poor coordination) </li>
</ul>

<p>If you are a smoker with diabetes, quitting smoking will benefit your health right away. People with diabetes who quit have better control of  their blood sugar levels.<sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup> </p>
