BMI is a fairly reliable indicator of body fatness for most people. BMI does not measure body fat directly, but research has shown that BMI correlates to direct measures of body fat, such as underwater weighing and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).<sup>1, 2</sup> BMI can be considered an alternative for direct measures of body fat. Additionally, BMI is an inexpensive and easy-to-perform method of screening for weight categories that may lead to health problems.</p><p class="topOPage"><a href="/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.html">Top of Page</a></p><h2><a id="Used" name="Used"><!-- --></a>How is BMI used?</h2><p>BMI is used as a screening tool to identify possible weight problems for adults. However, BMI is not a diagnostic tool. For example, a person may have a high BMI. However, to determine if excess weight is a health risk, a healthcare provider would need to perform further assessments. These assessments might include skinfold thickness measurements, evaluations of diet, physical activity, family history, and other appropriate health screenings.</p><p class="topOPage"><a href="/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.html">Top of Page</a></p><h2><a id="Why" name="Why"><!-- --></a>Why does CDC use BMI to measure overweight and obesity?</h2><p>Calculating BMI is one of the best methods for population assessment of overweight and obesity. Because calculation requires only height and weight, it is inexpensive and easy to use for clinicians and for the general public. The use of BMI allows people to compare their own weight status to that of the general population.</p><p>To see the formula based on either kilograms and meters or pounds and inches, visit <a href="/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.html#Interpreted">How is BMI calculated and interpreted</a>?</p><p class="topOPage"><a href="/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.html">Top of Page</a></p><h2><a id="Other Ways" name="Other Ways"><!-- --></a>What are some of the other ways to measure obesity? Why doesn't CDC use those to determine overweight and obesity among the general public?</h2><p>Other methods to measure body fatness include skinfold thickness measurements (with calipers), underwater weighing, bioelectrical impedance, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and isotope dilution. However, these methods are not always readily available, and they are either expensive or need highly trained personnel. Furthermore, many of these methods can be difficult to standardize across observers or machines, complicating comparisons across studies and time periods.</p><p class="topOPage"><a href="/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.html">Top of Page</a></p><h2><a id="Interpreted" name="Interpreted"><!-- --></a>How is BMI calculated and interpreted?</h2><p><strong>Calculation of BMI</strong><br/>BMI is calculated the same way for both adults and children.

For assessing someone's likelihood of developing overweight- or obesity-related diseases, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute guidelines recommend looking at two other predictors:</p><ul class="WHBulletsOneLevel"><li>The individual's waist circumference (because abdominal fat is a predictor of risk for obesity-related diseases).</li><li>Other risk factors the individual has for diseases and conditions associated with obesity (for example, high blood pressure or physical inactivity).</li></ul><p>For more information about the assessment of health risk for developing overweight- and obesity-related diseases, visit the following Web pages from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute:</p><ul class="WHBulletsOneLevel"><li><a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/public/heart/obesity/lose_wt/risk.htm">Assessing Your Risk</a></li><li><a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/bmi_tbl.htm">Body Mass Index Table</a></li><li><a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/ob_home.htm">Clinical Guidelines on the Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults</a></li></ul><p class="topOPage"><a href="/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.html">Top of Page</a></p><h2><a id="Athlete" name="Athlete"><!-- --></a>If an athlete or other person with a lot of muscle has a BMI over 25, is that person still considered to be overweight?</h2><p>According to the BMI weight status categories, anyone with a BMI over 25 would be classified as overweight and anyone with a BMI over 30 would be classified as obese.</p><p>It is important to remember, however, that BMI is not a direct measure of body fatness and that BMI is calculated from an individual's weight which includes both muscle and fat. As a result, some individuals may have a high BMI but not have a high percentage of body fat. For example, highly trained athletes may have a high BMI because of increased muscularity rather than increased body fatness. Although some people with a BMI in the overweight range (from 25.0 to 29.9) may not have excess body fatness, most people with a BMI in the obese range (equal to or greater than 30) will have increased levels of body fatness.</p><p>It is also important to remember that weight is only one factor related to risk for disease. If you have questions or concerns about the appropriateness of your weight, you should discuss them with your healthcare provider.</p><p class="topOPage"><a href="/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.html">Top of Page</a></p><h2><a id="Consequences" name="Consequences"><!-- --></a>What are the health consequences of overweight and obesity for adults?</h2><p>The BMI ranges are based on the relationship between body weight and disease and death.<sup>5</sup> Overweight and obese individuals are at increased risk for many diseases and health conditions, including the following: <sup>6</sup></p><ul class="WHBulletsOneLevel"><li>Hypertension</li><li>Dyslipidemia (for example, high LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, or high levels of triglycerides)</li><li>Type 2 diabetes</li><li>Coronary heart disease</li><li>Stroke</li><li>Gallbladder disease</li><li>Osteoarthritis</li><li>Sleep apnea and respiratory problems</li><li>Some cancers (endometrial, breast, and colon)</li></ul><p>For more information about these and other health problems associated with overweight and obesity, visit <a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/ob_home.htm">Clinical Guidelines on the Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults</a> .</p><p class="topOPage"><a href="/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.html">Top of Page</a></p><h2><a id="Children" name="Children"><!-- --></a>Is BMI interpreted the same way for children and teens as it is for adults?</h2><p>Although the BMI number is calculated the same way for children and adults, the criteria used to interpret the meaning of the BMI number for children and teens are different from those used for adults.
