Concussions can also occur from a blow to the body that causes the head to move rapidly back and forth. Even a "ding," "getting your bell rung," or what seems to be mild bump or blow to the head can be serious.</p><p>Concussions can occur in <em>any</em> sport or recreation activity. So, all coaches, parents, and athletes need to learn <a href="/concussion/sports/recognize.html">concussion signs and symptoms</a> and what to do <a href="/concussion/sports/response.html">if a concussion occurs</a>.</p><p>CDC's "<a href="/concussion/HeadsUp/high_school.html">Heads Up: Concussion in High School</a>" and "<a href="/concussion/HeadsUp/youth.html">Heads Up: Concussion in Youth Sports</a>" initiatives include materials and information to help coaches of all sports to help identify concussions and take immediate steps to respond when one is suspected.</p><h3>Prevention and Preparation</h3><!-- ### Image Caption ### --><div class="c33r" style=" padding-left: 10px;"><div class="subcr"><div class="cdc-caption"><strong><a class="noLinking" href="http://facebook.com/cdcheadsup"><img alt="Graphic: CDC's Heads Up on Brain Injury.

Parents and athletes should sign the concussion policy statement before the first practice.</p><p><strong>Insist that safety comes first.</strong> No one technique or safety equipment is 100 percent effective in preventing concussion, but there are things you can do to help minimize the risks for concussion and other injuries.</p><p>For example, to help prevent injuries:</p><ul><li>Enforce no hits to the head or other types of dangerous play.</li><li>Practice safe playing techniques and encourage athletes to follow the rules of play.</li><li>Make sure players wear approved and properly-fitted protective equipment. Protective equipment should be well-maintained and be worn consistently and correctly.</li></ul><p><strong>Learn about concussion.</strong> Before the first practice, talk your athlete(s) and others about the dangers of concussion and potential long-term consequences of concussion.
