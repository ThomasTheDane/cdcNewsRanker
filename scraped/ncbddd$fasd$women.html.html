This is because a woman could become pregnant and not know for several weeks or more. In the United States half of all pregnancies are unplanned.</p><div class="module rounders" style=" width: 90%;"><div class="inner"><div class="t"></div><h3>5 Things You Should Know about Drinking Alcohol during Pregnancy</h3><div class="subColumns"><div class="subc"><ol start="1" type="1"><li><strong>Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can cause a baby to be born with birth defects and have disabilities.</strong> These conditions, called fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, or FASDs, are among the top preventable birth defects and developmental disabilities. FASDs can cause problems in how a person grows, learns, looks, and acts. FASDs can also cause birth defects of the heart, brain, and other major organs. These problems last a lifetime.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>There is no known amount of alcohol that is safe to drink while pregnant.</strong> All drinks with alcohol can hurt an unborn baby. A 12-ounce can of beer has as much alcohol as a 5-ounce glass of wine or a 1-ounce shot of liquor.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>There is no safe time to drink during pregnancy.</strong> Alcohol can harm a baby at any time during pregnancy. It can cause problems in the early weeks of pregnancy, before a woman even knows she is pregnant.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Too many women continue to drink during pregnancy.</strong> About 1 in 8 pregnant women in the United States reports alcohol use in the past 30 days. And about 1 in 50 pregnant women in the United States reports binge drinking in the past 30 days (having five or more drinks at one time)*.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders are 100% preventable.</strong> Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are 100% preventable-if a woman does not drink alcohol while she is pregnant.</li></ol></div></div></div><div class="b"><div></div></div></div><p>*In these findings, binge drinking was defined as having five or more drinks at one time in the past 30 days. More recently, the definition of binge drinking for women has been changed to four or more drinks at one time in the past 30 days.</p><p>Â </p><h3>Tip Sheets</h3><br/><h5>If You Want to Get Pregnant</h5><p>Plan to have a healthy baby - don't drink alcohol.<br/><a href="http://www.womenandalcohol.org/pdf/Before%20You%20Get%20Pregnant.pdf" shape="rect">View and print  this fact sheet</a> with tips for not drinking alcohol if you are planning to get pregnant.</p><p>For more information on how to get ready for a healthy pregnancy, visit <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/preconception/index.html" shape="rect">Planning Pregnancy</a>.</p><br/><h5>If You're Pregnant</h5><p>Think about your baby's health - don't drink alcohol.<br/><a href="http://www.womenandalcohol.org/pdf/If%20Youre%20Pregnant.pdf" shape="rect">View and print this  fact sheet</a> with tips for not drinking alcohol during pregnancy and strategies to stop drinking.</p><p>For more healthy pregnancy tips, visit <a href="/pregnancy/during.html" shape="rect">CDC's healthy pregnancy  page</a>.</p><h5>If You Are Not Planning to Get Pregnant</h5><p>Take care of yourself "â avoid risky drinking.<br/><a href="http://www.womenandalcohol.org/pdf/Not%20Planning%20a%20Baby.pdf" shape="rect">View and print this fact sheet</a> with tips for not drinking too much alcohol and what to do if you drink at risky levels.</p><p><br/><br/>Â </p><h3>Standard-Sized Drinks</h3><br/><h5><img alt="Standard-Sized Drink Equivalents Chart" src="/ncbddd/fasd/images/standarddrinksizesm.jpg" style=" vertical-align: text-top;"/><br/><br/>Risky Drinking: More than 7 standard-sized drinks per week or more than 3 per occasion, and drinking when pregnant or trying to become pregnant.</h5><p>* Note: Depending on factors such as the type of spirits and the recipe, one mixed drink can contain from one to three or more standard drinks.</p><p>Source: National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.
