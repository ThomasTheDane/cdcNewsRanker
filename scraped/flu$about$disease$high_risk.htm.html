															<p>Most people who get the flu will have mild illness, will not need medical care or antiviral drugs, and will recover in less than two weeks. Some people, however, are more likely to get flu complications that result in being hospitalized and occasionally result in death. Pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections and ear infections are examples of flu-related complications. The flu also can make chronic health problems worse. For example, people with asthma may experience asthma attacks while they have the flu, and people with chronic congestive heart failure may experience a worsening of this condition that is triggered by the flu. The list below includes the groups of people more likely to get flu-related complications if they get sick from influenza.</p><h3>People at High Risk for Developing Flu-Related Complications</h3><ul><li><a href="/flu/parents/index.htm">Children younger than 5, but especially children younger than 2 years old</a></li><li><a href="/flu/about/disease/65over.htm">Adults 65 years of age and older</a></li><li><a href="/flu/protect/vaccine/pregnant.htm">Pregnant women</a></li><li>Also, <a href="/flu/pdf/freeresources/native/protect_circle_life_factsheet.pdf">American Indians and Alaskan Natives [1.1 MB, 2 pages]</a> seem to be at higher risk of flu complications</li></ul><h3><a id="medical-conditions" name="medical-conditions"></a>People who have medical conditions including:</h3><ul><li><a href="/flu/asthma/index.htm">Asthma</a></li><li>Neurological and neurodevelopmental conditions [including disorders of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and muscle such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy (seizure disorders), stroke, intellectual disability (mental retardation), moderate to severe developmental delay, muscular dystrophy, or spinal cord injury].</li><li>Chronic lung disease (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] and cystic fibrosis)</li><li><a href="/flu/heartdisease/index.htm">Heart disease</a> (such as congenital heart disease, congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease)</li><li>Blood disorders (such as sickle cell disease)</li><li>Endocrine disorders (such as <a href="/flu/diabetes/index.htm">diabetes</a> mellitus)</li><li>Kidney disorders</li><li>Liver disorders</li><li>Metabolic disorders (such as inherited metabolic disorders and mitochondrial disorders)</li><li>Weakened immune system due to disease or medication (such as people with <a href="/flu/protect/hiv-flu.htm">HIV or AIDS</a>, or <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/flu/" shape="rect">cancer</a>, or those on chronic steroids)</li><li>People younger than 19 years of age who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy</li><li>People who are morbidly obese (<a href="/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/index.html">Body Mass Index, or BMI</a>, of 40 or greater)</li></ul> 																</div>
