        particle:</strong> the nucleus of a helium atom, made up of two <a href="#neutron">neutrons</a> 
        and two <a href="#proton">protons</a> with a charge of +2. Certain radioactive 
        nuclei emit alpha particles. Alpha particles generally carry more energy 
        than <a href="#gammaray">gamma</a> or <a href="#betaparticle">beta particles</a>, 
        and deposit that energy very quickly while passing through tissue. Alpha 
        particles can be stopped by a thin layer of light material, such as a 
        sheet of paper, and cannot penetrate the outer, dead layer of skin. Therefore, 
        they do not damage living tissue when outside the body. When alpha-emitting 
        atoms are inhaled or swallowed, however, they are especially damaging 
        because they transfer relatively large amounts of ionizing energy to living 
        cells. <em>See also</em> <a href="#betaparticle">beta particle</a>, <a href="#gammaray">gamma

        pose a serious direct or external radiation threat and can be lethal depending 
        on the amount received. They also pose a serious internal radiation threat

            <a id="primer" name="primer"></a>Primer on Radiation Measurement          </h2>
          <p>In the 
            aftermath of a radiological emergency the public will see radiation 
            and its potential hazards described in many different and sometimes 
            confusing ways. This primer is intended to help journalists and community 
            leaders understand these terms.</p>
          <p>Activity 
            or radioactivity is measured by the number of atoms disintegrating 
            per unit time. A <em><strong>becquerel </strong></em>is 1 disintegration 
            per second. A <em><strong>curie</strong></em> is 37 billion disintegrations 
            per second, which is the number of disintegrations per second in 1 
            gram of pure radium. A disintegrating atom can emit a beta particle, 
            an alpha particle, a gamma ray, or some combination of all these, 
            so becquerels or curies alone do not provide enough information to 
            assess the risk to a person from a radioactive source.</p>
          <p>Disintegrating 
            atoms emit different forms of radiation–—alpha particles, 
            beta particles, gamma rays, or x-rays. As radiation moves through 
            the body, it dislodges electrons from atoms, disrupting molecules. 
            Each time this happens, the radiation loses some energy until it escapes 
            from the body or disappears. The energy deposited indicates the number 
            of molecules disrupted. The energy the radiation deposits in tissue 
            is called the <em><strong>dose</strong></em>, or more correctly, the 
            <em><strong>absorbed dose</strong></em>. The units of measure for 
            absorbed dose are the gray (1 joule per kilogram of tissue) or the 
            <em><strong>rad</strong></em> (1/100 of a gray). The <em><strong>cumulative 
            dose</strong></em> is the total absorbed dose or energy deposited 
            by the body or a region of the body from repeated or prolonged exposures.</p>
          <p>Alpha 
            particles, beta particles, gamma rays, and x-rays affect tissue in 
            different ways. Alpha particles disrupt more molecules in a shorter 
            distance than gamma rays. A measure of the biologic risk of the energy 
            deposited is the <em><strong>dose equivalent</strong></em>. The units 
            of dose equivalent are <em><strong>sieverts</strong></em> or <em><strong>rem</strong></em>. 
            Dose equivalent is calculated by multiplying the absorbed dose by 
            a <em><strong>quality factor</strong></em>.</p>
          <p>Sometimes 
            a large number of people have been exposed to a source of ionizing 
            radiation. To assess the potential health effects, scientists often 
            multiply the exposure per person by the number of persons and call 
            this the <em><strong>collective dose</strong></em>. Collective dose 
            is expressed as “person-rem” or “person-sieverts.” 
             
          </p><p><strong>Abbreviations 
            for Radiation Measurements</strong><br/>
            When the amounts of radiation being measured are less than 1, prefixes 
            are attached to the unit of measure as a type of shorthand. This is 
            called scientific notation and is used in many scientific fields. 
            The table below shows the prefixes for radiation measurement and their 
            associated numeric notations.</p>

          <p><strong>Health 
            Effects of Radiation Exposure </strong><br/>
            Exposure to radiation can cause two kinds of health effects. <em><strong>Deterministic 
            effects </strong></em>are observable health effects that occur soon 
            after receipt of large doses. These may include hair loss, skin burns, 
            nausea, or death. <em><strong>Stochastic effects</strong></em> are 
            long-term effects, such as cancer. The radiation dose determines the 
            severity of a deterministic effect and the probability of a stochastic 
            effect.</p>
          <p> The 
            object of any radiation control program is to prevent any deterministic 
            effects and minimize the risk for stochastic effects. When a person 
            inhales or ingests a radionuclide, the body will absorb different 
            amounts of that radionuclide in different organs, so each organ will 
            receive a different <em><strong>organ dose</strong></em>. </p>
          <p>Federal 
            Guidance Report 11 (FGR-11) from the Environmental Protection Agency 
            (EPA) lists <em><strong>dose conversion factors</strong></em> for 
            all radionuclides. This report can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.epa.gov/radiation/pubs.html#people_environment">http://www.epa.gov/radiation/pubs.html</a>, under "Limiting Values of Radionuclide Intake and Air Concentration and Dose Conversion Factors for Inhalation, Submersion, and Ingestion, Report No. 11 (PDF)". 
            The dose conversion factor for each organ is the number of rem delivered 
            to that organ by each curie or becquerel of intake of a specific radioisotope.</p>
          <p><strong>External, 
            Internal, and Absorbed Doses </strong><br/>
            A person can receive an <em><strong>external dose</strong></em> by 
            standing near a gamma or high-energy beta-emitting source. A person 
            can receive an <em><strong>internal dose</strong></em> by ingesting 
            or inhaling radioactive material. The external exposure stops when 
            the person leaves the area of the source. The internal exposure continues 
            until the radioactive material is flushed from the body by natural 
            processes or decays.</p>
          <p>A person 
            who has ingested a radioactive material receives an internal dose 
            to several different organs. The absorbed dose to each organ is different, 
            and the sensitivity of each organ to radiation is different. FGR-11 
            assigns a different weighting factor to each organ. To determine a 
            person’s risk for cancer, multiply each organ’s dose by 
            its weighting factor, and add the results; the sum is the <em><strong>effective 
            dose equivalent</strong></em> (“effective” because it 
            is not really the dose to the whole body, but a sum of the relative 
            risks to each organ; and “equivalent” because it is presented 
            in rem or sieverts instead of rads or gray).</p>
          <p><strong>Committed 
            and Total Effective Dose Equivalents </strong><br/>
            When a person inhales or ingests a radionuclide, that radionuclide 
            is distributed to different organs and stays there for days, months, 
            or years until it decays or is excreted. The radionuclide will deliver 
            a radiation dose over a period of time. The dose that a person receives 
            from the time the nuclide enters the body until it is gone is the 
            <em><strong>committed dose</strong></em>. FGR-11 calculates doses 
            over a 50-year period and presents the <em><strong>committed dose 
            equivalent</strong></em> for each organ plus the <em><strong>committed 
            effective dose equivalent</strong></em> (CEDE).</p>
          <p>A person 
            can receive both an internal dose and an external dose. The sum of 
            the committed effective dose equivalent (CEDE) and the external dose 
            is called the <em> <strong>total effective dose equivalent</strong></em> 
            (TEDE).</p>
