       <h4>Practice proper hand hygiene</h4>
       <p>Wash your hands carefully with soap and water—</p>                      
       <ul>
        <li> especially after using the toilet and changing diapers, and</li>
        <li> always before eating, preparing, or handling food.</li>
       </ul>
       <p><img alt="Close-up of a pair of human hands washing with soap" class="stroke lefty" height="100" src="/norovirus/images/handwashing.jpg" width="100"/>Noroviruses can be found in your vomit or stool even before you start feeling sick. The virus can stay in your stool for 2 weeks or more after you feel better. So, it is important to continue washing your hands often during this time.</p><p>Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can be used in addition to hand washing. But, they should not be used as a substitute for washing with soap and water. See â<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/">Handwashing: Clean Hands Save Lives.</a>â</p>
       <h4>Wash fruits and vegetables and cook seafood thoroughly</h4>
       <img alt="Variety of seafood" class="stroke righty" height="125" src="/norovirus/images/seafood.jpg" width="188"/>
       <p>Carefully wash fruits and vegetables before preparing and eating them. Cook oysters and other shellfish thoroughly before eating them.</p>
       <p>Be aware that noroviruses are relatively resistant. They can survive temperatures as high as 140Â°F and quick steaming processes that are often used for cooking shellfish.  </p>
       <p>Food that might be contaminated with norovirus should be thrown out.</p>
       <p>Keep sick infants and children out of areas where food is being handled and prepared.</p>
       <h4>When you are sick, do not prepare food or care for others who are sick</h4>
       <p>You should not prepare food for others or provide healthcare while you are sick and for at least 2 to 3 days after you recover. This also applies to sick workers in settings such as schools and daycares where they may expose people to norovirus.</p>
       <p>Many local and state health departments require that food handlers and preparers with norovirus illness not work until at least 2 to 3 days after they recover. If you were recently sick, you can be given different duties in the restaurant, such as working at a cash register or hosting.</p>
       <h4>Clean and disinfect contaminated surfaces</h4>
       <p><img alt="Woman mopping up overflowing bathtub" class="stroke lefty" height="133" src="/norovirus/images/bucket.jpg" width="100"/>After throwing up or having diarrhea, immediately clean and disinfect contaminated surfaces. Use a chlorine bleach solution with a concentration of 1000â5000 ppm (5â25 tablespoons of household bleach [5.25%] per gallon of water) or other disinfectant registered as effective against norovirus by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). For more information, see <a href="http://www.epa.gov/oppad001/list_g_norovirus.pdf">EPAâs Registered Antimicrobial Products Effective Against Norovirus (Norwalk-like virus)[11 pages]</a>.</p>
       <p><span class="note_head">Note:</span> Evidence for efficacy of a cleaning agent against norovirus is usually based on studies using feline calicivirus (FCV)—a virus related to norovirus—as a surrogate. However, FCV and norovirus exhibit different physiochemical properties; thus, it is unclear whether inactivation of FCV by a specific cleaning agent reflects efficacy of such solutions against norovirus.</p>

       <p>Immediately remove and wash clothes or linens that may be contaminated with vomit or stool (feces).</p>
       <p>You should</p>
       <ul>
        <li>handle soiled items carefully without agitating them,</li>
        <li>wear rubber or disposable gloves while handling soiled items and wash your hands after, and</li>
        <li>wash the items with detergent at the maximum available cycle length then machine dry them.</li>
