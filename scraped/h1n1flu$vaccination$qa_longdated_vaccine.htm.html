                        <h3><a id="a" name="a"></a>Background</h3>
                        <p>Unlike  seasonal influenza vaccine which typically expires on June 30th, the 2009 H1N1  monovalent influenza vaccine expiration dates range from February 2010 to early  2011.Â  Sanofi Pasteur multi-dose vials  (MDV), specifically, have expiration dates in 2011. Additional 2009 H1N1 influenza  activity (i.e. "third wave") is possible through spring and summer of 2010, or  in early fall 2010 when the 2010-11 trivalent influenza vaccine is not yet  available.Â  Although the 2010-11 seasonal  trivalent influenza vaccine will contain a 2009 H1N1-like influenza A strain,  the timing of its production and availability is not yet known.<br/><br/> 
The  purpose of this document is to address questions raised by the long-expiry  vaccine.</p>


<h3><a id="b" name="b"></a>How should grantees handle Sanofi Pasteur 2009 H1N1 vaccine that expires next year?</h3>
                        <p>Viable 2009 H1N1 Sanofi Pasteur MDV should not be  destroyed until 2010-11 seasonal vaccine (which will contain 2009 H1N1 strain)  is widely available. It should be stored in the event there is a resurgence of  disease before the 2010-2011 vaccine is available. </p>
                        
                        
                        <h3><a id="c" name="c"></a>Should the long-dated 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine be used instead of 2010-2011 seasonal influenza vaccine?</h3>
                        <p>The 2010-2011 seasonal vaccine will contain two other  strains in addition to the 2009 H1N1 strain. For this reason the 2009 H1N1monovalent  vaccine will not be considered a substitute for the seasonal Â trivalent vaccine. It would only be used in  the event ofÂ  a resurgence in disease  before the 2010-2011 seasonal vaccine is widely available.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3><a id="d" name="d"></a>What should grantees do with excess viable 2009 H1N1 monovalent vaccine?</h3>
                        <p>Grantees should identify a way of storing viable  vaccine in the event of a resurgence of 2009 H1N1 disease before the 2010-2011  trivalent vaccine is widely available. Because providers may want to free up  their refrigerator storage, states may choose to accept vaccine back from  providers if vaccine viability and cold chain integrity can be assured.Â  States must review provider temperature logs  for vaccine while in their possession to ensure that the vaccine has been  properly stored before accepting this vaccine back from providers.</p>
                        
                        <h3><a id="e" name="e"></a>Can unused or expired 2009 H1N1 monovalent vaccine be sent back to McKesson?</h3>
                        <p>Unused or expired vaccine should not be sent back to  McKesson.</p>
                        
                        
                        <h3><a id="f" name="f"></a>How long should grantees plan to store the long-dated 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine?</h3>
                        <p>At a minimum, grantees should plan to store such  vaccine until seasonal vaccine distribution is well underway. The time at  which sufficient supply can be assured is difficult to predict given year to  year variations. Distribution of seasonal influenza vaccine by  manufacturers will be monitored by CDC and CDC expects to issue a  recommendation that stored vaccine no longer needs to be kept once available  information indicates a robust supply, in order to minimize confusion about  which flu vaccine (2010-11 trivalent vaccine versus 2009 H1N1 monovalent  vaccine) should be administered</p>
                        .
<h3><a id="g" name="g"></a>What should grantees say to providers about current vaccination efforts?</h3>
                        <p>CDC recommends direct communication with health  care providers and retailers to continue to encourage vaccination of people  with high risk conditions. As part of this communication, CDC recommends  that state health departments request that retailers, pharmacies, and  healthcare providers retain their unexpired 2009 H1N1 vaccine supplies as a  reserve, should demand for vaccination increase before seasonal vaccine becomes  available</p>
                        
                        
                        <h3><a id="h" name="h"></a>Can PHER funds be used to cover vaccine storage?</h3>
                        <p>PHER funds can be used for storage until July 30, 2010, but at this time there is no carry over authority for PHER funds past  July 30, 2010. Grantees will be kept informed of any changes to this policy.</p>
