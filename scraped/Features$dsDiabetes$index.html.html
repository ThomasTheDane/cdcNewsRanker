Because most minority populations are younger and tend to develop diabetes at earlier ages than the non-Hispanic white population, it is important to control for population age differences when making race and ethnic comparisons.</p><p>After adjusting for population age differences, 16.5% of the total adult population served by IHS in 2005 had diagnosed diabetes, with rates varying by region from 6.0% among Alaska Native adults to 29.3% among American Indian adults in southern Arizona.</p><img alt="Hispanics with Diabetes by Place of Origin, 2004-2006" class="righty" height="295" src="/features/dsdiabetes/dsdiabetes_placeoforigin_270px.jpg" width="270"/> <p>After adjusting for population age differences, 2004-2006 national survey data for people aged 20 years or older indicate that 6.6% of non-Hispanic whites, 7.5% of Asian Americans, 10.4% of Hispanics, and 11.8% of non-Hispanic blacks had diagnosed diabetes. Among Hispanics, rates were 8.2% for Cubans, 11.9% for Mexican Americans, and 12.6% for Puerto Ricans.</p><h4>Data Source</h4><p style="margin-bottom:50px">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
