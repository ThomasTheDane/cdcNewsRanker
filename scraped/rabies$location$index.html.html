More than 90% of all animal cases reported annually to CDC now occur in wildlife; before 1960 the majority were in domestic animals. The principal rabies hosts today are wild carnivores and bats.</p><p>The number of rabies-related human deaths in the United States has declined from more than 100 annually at the turn of the century to one or two per year in the 1990's. Modern day prophylaxis has proven nearly 100% successful.</p><p class="somemore"><a href="/rabies/location/usa/index.html" shape="rect">More</a></p>        						  </div>

        	              <img alt="Map of the world" class="righty border" height="98px" src="/rabies/images/world.jpg"/> <p>Despite evidence that control of dog rabies through programs of animal vaccination and elimination of stray dogs can reduce the incidence of human rabies, exposure to rabid dogs is still the cause of over 90% of human exposures to rabies and of over 99% of human deaths worldwide. Because vaccines to prevent human rabies have been available for more than 100 years, most deaths from rabies occur in countries with inadequate public health resources and limited access to preventive treatment. These countries also have few diagnostic facilities and almost no rabies surveillance.</p><p class="somemore"><a href="/rabies/location/world/index.html" shape="rect">More</a></p>        						  </div>
