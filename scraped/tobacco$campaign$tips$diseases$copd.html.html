<h3><a id="what_is" name="what_is"></a>What Is COPD?</h3>
<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a serious  lung disease that gradually makes it harder and harder to breathe. COPD  includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis.<sup><a href="#one">1,</a><a href="#two">2</a></sup> </p>
<p>With COPD, less air flows through the  airways—the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs—because  of one or more of the following:<sup><a href="#three">3,</a><a href="#four">4</a></sup></p>
<ul>
  <li>The airways and tiny air sacs in the  lungs lose their ability to stretch and shrink back.</li>
  <li>The walls between many of the air sacs  are destroyed.</li>
  <li>The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed (irritated and swollen).</li>
  <li>The airways make more mucus than usual,  which can clog them and block air flow. </li>
</ul>

<p>In the early stages of COPD, there may be no symptoms, or  you may only have mild symptoms, such as:<sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup></p>
<ul>
  <li>A nagging cough (often called "smoker's  cough")</li>
  <li>Shortness of breath, especially with physical  activity</li>
  <li>Wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe)</li>
  <li>Tightness in the chest</li>
</ul>

<p>As the disease gets worse, symptoms may include:<sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup></p>
<ul>
  <li>Having trouble catching your breath or talking</li>
  <li>Blue or gray lips and/or fingernails (a sign of  low oxygen levels in your blood)</li>
  <li>Trouble with mental alertness</li>
  <li>A very fast heartbeat</li>
  <li>Swelling in the feet and ankles</li>
  <li>Weight loss</li>
</ul>

<p>How severe your symptoms  are depends on the extent of lung damage. If you keep smoking, the damage will  get worse faster than if you stop smoking.<sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup> Among 15 million U.S.  adults with COPD, 39% continue to smoke.<sup><a href="#six">6</a></sup> </p>

<h3><a id="how_related" name="how_related"></a>How Is Smoking Related to COPD?</h3>
<p>COPD—the number 3 killer in the nation—is almost always  caused by smoking.<sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup> Smoking accounts for as many as 9 out of 10  COPD-related deaths.<sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup> </p>
<p>COPD most often occurs in people age 40 and older with a  history of smoking (either current or former smokers). However, as many as one  out of six people with COPD never smoked.<sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup> </p>
<p>Smoking during childhood and teenage years can slow how  lungs grow and develop. This can increase the risk of developing COPD in  adulthood.<sup><a href="#seven">7</a></sup> </p>

<h3><a id="how_prevented" name="how_prevented"></a>How Can COPD Be Prevented?</h3>
 
<p>The best way to prevent COPD is to never start smoking, and if you smoke, quit. Talk with your health care provider about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, stay away from secondhand smoke, which is smoke in the air from other people smoking.<sup><a href="#eight">8</a></sup></p>

<h3><a id="how_treated" name="how_treated"></a>How Is COPD Treated?</h3>
<p>Quitting smoking is the most important first step you can  take to treat COPD. Avoiding secondhand smoke is also critical. Other lifestyle  changes and treatments include one or more of the following:<sup><a href="#nine">9</a></sup></p>
<ul>
  <li>For people with COPD who have trouble eating  because of shortness of breath or being tired—a special meal plan with smaller,  more frequent meals; resting before eating; and/or taking vitamins and  nutritional supplements</li>
  <li>A special activity plan to help strengthen the muscles used for  breathing </li>
  <li>Medicines such as:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>A  bronchodilator to relax the muscles around the airways. This helps open airways  and makes breathing easier. Most bronchodilators are taken with a device called  an inhaler.</li>
    <li>An  inhaled steroid to reduce swelling in the airways.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Oxygen therapy, which can help people who have severe COPD and low  levels of oxygen in their blood to breathe better</li>
  <li>Surgery for people who have severe symptoms that have not improved with  other treatments </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Lung  volume reduction surgery (LVRS): Surgery to remove diseased parts of the lung so  healthier lung tissue can work better. LVRS is not a cure for COPD. </li>
    <li>A lung  transplant: Surgery in which one or two healthy lungs from a donor are put in  the patient’s body to replace diseased lungs. A lung transplant is a last  resort.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>Even  though there is no cure for COPD, these lifestyle changes and treatments  can help you breathe easier, stay more active, and slow the progress of the  disease.<sup><a href="#nine">9</a></sup></p>
