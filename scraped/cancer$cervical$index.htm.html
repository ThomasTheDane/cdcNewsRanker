<p>Cancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow out of control. Cancer is always named for the part of the body where it starts, even if it spreads to other body parts later.</p>

<p>When cancer starts in the cervix, it is called cervical cancer. The cervix is the lower, narrow end of the uterus. The cervix connects the vagina (birth canal) to the upper part of the uterus. The uterus (or womb) is where a baby grows when a woman is pregnant.</p>

<p>Cervical cancer is highly preventable in most Western countries because <a class="mobileHide" href="basic_info/screening.htm">screening tests</a><a class="hideDesktop" href="http://m.cdc.gov/en/HealthSafetyTopics/DiseasesConditions/Cancer/Gynecologic/Cervical/screening">screening tests</a> and a <a class="mobileDisableHyperlink" href="http://www.cdc.gov/hpv/vaccine.html">vaccine</a> to prevent HPV infections are available. When cervical cancer is found early, it is highly treatable and associated with long survival and good quality of life.</p>

<h2>Who Gets Cervical Cancer?</h2>

<p>All women are at risk for cervical cancer. It occurs most often in women over age 30. Each year, about 12,000 women in the United States get cervical cancer.<span class="smallText">†</span></p>

<p>The <a class="mobileDisableHyperlink" href="http://www.cdc.gov/hpv/">human papillomavirus (HPV)</a> is the main <a class="mobileHide" href="/cancer/hpv/basic_info/">cause of cervical cancer.</a><a class="hideDesktop" href="http://m.cdc.gov/en/HealthSafetyTopics/DiseasesConditions/Cancer/HPV/basicInfo">cause of cervical cancer.</a> HPV is a common virus that is passed from one person to another during sex. At least half of sexually active people will have HPV at some point in their lives, but few women will get cervical cancer.</p>
