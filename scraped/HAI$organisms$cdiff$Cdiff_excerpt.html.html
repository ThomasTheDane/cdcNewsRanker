                    <h3><em>b.  Clostridium difficile</em></h3>
                    <p><em>Clostridium  difficile </em>is  the most frequent etiologic agent for health-careâassociated diarrhea.  In one hospital, 30% of adults who developed health-careâassociated  diarrhea were positive for <em>C.difficile</em>. One recent study employing  PCR-ribotyping techniques demonstrated that cases of <em>C.difiicile</em>-acquired  diarrhea occurring in the hospital included patients whose infections were  attributed to endogenous <em>C. difficile </em>strains  and patients whose illnesses were considered to be  health-careâassociated infections. Most patients remain asymptomatic  after infection, but the organism continues to be shed in their stools.  Risk factors for acquiring <em>C. difficile</em>-associated infection  include a) exposure to antibiotic therapy, particularly with  beta-lactam agents; b) gastrointestinal procedures and surgery; c)  advanced age; and d) indiscriminate use of antibiotics. Of all the  measures that have been used to prevent the spread of <em>C. difficile</em>-associated diarrhea, the  most successful has been the restriction of the use of antimicrobial agents.</p>
                    <p><em>C.  difficile </em>is  an anaerobic, gram-positive bacterium. Normally fastidious in its  vegetative state, it is capable of sporulating when environmental  conditions no longer support its continued growth. The capacity to form  spores enables the organism to persist in the environment (e.g., in  soil and on dry surfaces) for extended periods of time. Environmental  contamination by this microorganism is well known, especially in places  where fecal contamination may occur. The environment (especially  housekeeping surfaces) rarely serves as a direct source of infection  for patients. However, direct exposure to contaminated patient-care  items (e.g., rectal thermometers) and high-touch surfaces in patientsâ  bathrooms (e.g., light switches) have been implicated as sources of  infection. </p>
                    <p>Transfer of the pathogen to the patient via the hands  of health-care workers is thought to be the most likely mechanism of  exposure. Standard isolation techniques intended to minimize enteric  contamination of patients, health-careâworkersâ hands, patient-care  items, and environmental surfaces have been published. Handwashing  remains the most effective means of reducing hand contamination. Proper  use of gloves is an ancillary measure that helps to further minimize  transfer of these pathogens from one surface to another.                    </p>
                    <p>The  degree to which the environment becomes contaminated with <em>C. difficile </em>spores  is proportional to the number of patients with <em>C. difficile</em>-associated  diarrhea, although asymptomatic, colonized patients may also serve as a  source of contamination. Few studies have examined the use of specific  chemical germicides for the inactivation of <em>C. difficile </em>spores,  and no well-controlled trials have been conducted to determine efficacy  of surface disinfection and its impact on health-careâassociated  diarrhea. Some investigators have evaluated the use of  chlorine-containing chemicals (e.g., 1,000 ppm hypochlorite at  recommended use-dilution, 5,000 ppm sodium hypochlorite [1:10 v/v  dilution], 1:100 v/v dilutions of unbuffered hypochlorite, and  phosphate-buffered hypochlorite [1,600 ppm]). One of the studies  demonstrated that the number of contaminated environmental sites was  reduced by half, whereas another two studies demonstrated declines in  health-careâassociated <em>C. difficile </em>infections in a HSCT unit  and in two geriatric medical units during a period of hypochlorite use.  The presence of confounding factors, however, was acknowledged in one  of these studies. The recommended approach to environmental infection  control with respect to <em>C.  difficile </em>is meticulous cleaning  followed by disinfection using hypochlorite-based germicides as  appropriate. However, because no EPA-registered surface disinfectants  with label claims for inactivation of <em>C. difficile </em>spores  are available, the recommendation is based on the best available evidence from  the scientific literature.</p>
                    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
                    <h3>VI. Special Pathogens</h3>
                    <p>G.  Because no EPA-registered products are specific for inactivating <em>Clostridium  difficile</em><br/>
                      spores, use hypochlorite-based products for disinfection of  environmental surfaces in those patient-care areas where surveillance  and epidemiology indicate ongoing transmission of <em>C. difficile</em>. <strong><em>Category II</em></strong></p>
                    <p> H. <strong>No  recommendation is offered </strong>regarding the use of specific EPA-registered  hospital<br/>
                      disinfectants  with respect to environmental control of <em>C. difficile</em>. <strong><em>Unresolved  issue</em></strong></p>
