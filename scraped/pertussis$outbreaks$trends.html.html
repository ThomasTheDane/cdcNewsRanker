              <p>During 2012, 48,277 cases of pertussis were reported to CDC. The incidence rate of pertussis among infants exceeds that of all other age groups. The second highest rates of disease are observed among children 7 through 10 years old. Rates also increased in adolescents 13 and 14 years of age. 20 pertussis-related deaths during 2012 have been reported to CDC. The majority of deaths occurred among infants younger than 3 months of age.</p>
              <p>During 2012, increased pertussis cases or outbreaks were reported in a majority of states. Forty-nine states and Washington, D.C. reported increases in disease in 2012 compared with 2011.</p>
              <p>Overall reporting of pertussis has declined during 2013. While 13 states and Washington, D.C. have reported an increase in pertussis cases compared with the same time during 2012, the majority of states have reported fewer cases in 2013 to-date.</p>
              <p>See the <a href="/pertussis/surv-reporting.html">annual number</a> of reported pertussis cases going back to 2000 or view the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/mmwr_wk/wk_cvol.html">latest number of cases</a> reported by states and territories. Since there is a lag in reporting to CDC, the most up-to-date information for states and territories is available from local health departments. Final 2012 reported cases are expected to be published by September 2013.</p>
