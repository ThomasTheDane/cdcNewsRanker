            <h2><a id="a" name="a"></a>Teen Pregnancy in the United States</h2>
            <p>In 2011, a total of 329,797 Â babies were born to women aged 15â19 years,  for a live birth rate of 31.3 per 1,000  women in this age group.<a href="#_edn1"><sup>1</sup></a> This is a record low for U.S. teens in this age  group, and a drop of 8% from 2010. Birth rates fell 11% for women aged 15â17  years, and 7% for women aged 18â19 years. While reasons for the declines are not clear,  teens seem to be less sexually active, and more of those who are sexually  active seem to be using birth control than in previous years.<a href="#_edn2"><sup>2</sup></a> </p>

            <h2><a id="b" name="b"></a>Disparities in Teen  Birth Rates</h2>
           
                <p>Teen birth rates declined for all races and for Hispanics except for 18â19 year old Asian/Pacific  Islanders, for whom rates did not change. The decline was greatest for Hispanic  teens, with a drop of 11% from 2010. Despite these declines, substantial  disparities persist in teen birth rates, and teen pregnancy and childbearing  continue to carry significant social and economic costs. The U.S. teen  pregnancy, birth, sexually transmitted disease (STD), and abortion rates are  substantially higher than those of other western industrialized nations.<a href="#_edn3"><sup>3</sup></a>
                </p><p><img alt="Female and male teen." border="1" class="righty" height="133" src="/TeenPregnancy/images/Blackfemaleteen_Hispanicmaleteen.jpg" width="200"/>Non-Hispanic black youth, Hispanic/Latino youth, American  Indian/Alaska Native youth, and socioeconomically disadvantaged youth of any  race or ethnicity experience the highest rates of teen pregnancy and  childbirth. Together, black and Hispanic youth comprised 57% of U.S. teen  births in 2011.<a href="#_edn1"><sup>1</sup></a> CDC is focusing on these priority populations because of the  need for greater public health efforts to improve the life opportunities of  adolescents facing significant health disparities, as well as to have the  greatest impact on overall U.S. teen birth rates. Other priority populations  for CDC’s teen pregnancy prevention efforts include young people in foster care  and the juvenile justice system, and those otherwise living in conditions of  risk. 
            </p><h2><a id="c" name="c"></a>The Importance of  Prevention</h2>
            Teen pregnancy and childbearing bring substantial social and  economic costs through immediate and long-term impacts on teen parents and  their children.

            <ul>
              <li>In 2008, teen pregnancy and childbirth accounted  for nearly $11 billion per year in costs to U.S. taxpayers for increased health  care and foster care, increased incarceration rates among children of teen  parents, and lost tax revenue because of lower educational attainment and income  among teen mothers.<sup><a href="#_edn4">4</a></sup></li>
              <li>Pregnancy and birth are significant contributors  to high school drop out rates among girls. Only about 50% of teen mothers  receive a high school diploma by 22 years of age, versus approximately 90% of  women who had not given birth during adolescence.<sup><a href="#_edn5">5</a></sup></li>
              <li>The children of teenage mothers are more likely  to have lower school achievement and drop out of high school, have more health  problems, be incarcerated at some time during adolescence, give birth as a  teenager, and face unemployment as a young adult.<sup><a href="#_edn6">6</a></sup></li>
          </ul>
            <p>These effects remain for the teen mother and her child even  after adjusting for those factors that increased the teenager’s risk for  pregnancy, such as growing up in poverty, having parents with low levels of  education, growing up in a single-parent family, and having Â poor performance in school.

            <h2>CDC Priority: Reducing Teen Pregnancy and Promoting Health Equity Among Youth</h2>
            Teen pregnancy prevention is one of CDC’s top six  priorities, a “winnable battle” in public health, and of paramount importance  to health and quality of life for our youth. 
            Evidence-based teen pregnancy prevention programs typically  address specific protective factors on the basis of knowledge, skills, beliefs,  or attitudes related to teen pregnancy.
