Preconception health and health care focus on things you can do before and between pregnancies to increase the chances of having a healthy baby. For some women, getting their body ready for pregnancy takes a few months. For other women, it might take longer. Whether this is your first, second, or sixth baby, the following are important steps to help you get ready for the healthiest pregnancy possible.</p><p><!-- --></p><h3>1. Make a Plan and Take Action</h3><p class="bullet_indent20px">Whether or not youâve written them down, youâve probably thought about your goals for having or not having children, and how to achieve those goals. For example, when you didnât want to have a baby, you used effective birth control methods to achieve your goals. Now that youâre thinking about getting pregnant, itâs really important to take steps to achieve your goalâgetting pregnant and having a healthy baby!<br/><br/><a href="/preconception/showyourlove/documents/Healthier_Baby_Me_Plan.pdf">Get started by using this checklist to help you set your goals for the year</a>.<br/><br/>Â </p><h3>2.
