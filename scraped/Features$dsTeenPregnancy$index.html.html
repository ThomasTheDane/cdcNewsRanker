Examples include education, housing and the built environment, transportation, employment opportunities, the law, and the justice system. The health care and public health systems are also social determinants of health.</p></div></div></div><div class="b"><div><!-- --></div></div></div></div></div><!-- #### END SIDE BOX #### --><p>In addition to building the evidence to support programs and clinical services to prevent teen pregnancy through individual behavior change, research is shedding light on the complexity of <em>social determinants</em> of teen pregnancy.</p><p><strong>Geographic Disparities</strong></p><ul><li>Southern and some western states have persistently higher teen birth rates than northern and eastern states, regardless of race/ethnicity.<sup>3</sup></li><li>Teen birth rates are higher in rural counties than in urban centers and in suburban counties regardless of race/ethnicity. In 2010, the teen birth rate in rural counties was nearly one-third higher compared to the rest of the country (43 versus 33 births per 1,000 females aged 15-19 years).<sup>4</sup></li><li>Between 1990 and 2010, the birth rate among teens in rural counties declined 32%, which was slower than the decline in urban centers (49%) and in suburban counties (40%).<sup>4</sup></li></ul><p><strong>Socioeconomic Disparities</strong></p><ul><li>Socioeconomic conditions in communities and families may contribute to high teen birth rates. Examples of these factors includeâ <ul><li>Low education and low income levels of a teenâs family.<sup>5</sup></li><li>Few opportunities in a teenâs community for positive youth involvement.<sup>5</sup></li><li>Neighborhood segregation.<sup>5</sup></li><li>Neighborhood physical disorder (graffiti, abandoned vehicles, litter, alcohol containers, cigarette butts, glass on the ground).<sup>5</sup></li><li>Neighborhood-level income inequality.<sup>5</sup></li></ul></li><li>Teens in child welfare systems are at increased risk of teen pregnancy and birth than other groups.
