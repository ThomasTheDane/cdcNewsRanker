Once a person or animal (for example, cats, dogs, cattle, deer, and beavers) has been infected with <em>Giardia</em>, the parasite lives in the intestines and is passed in feces (poop). Once outside the body, <em>Giardia</em> can sometimes survive for weeks or months. <em>Giardia</em> can be found within every region of the U.S. and around the world.</p><p><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="how" name="how" title="How do you get giardiasis and how is it spread?">Â </a></p><h4>How do you get giardiasis and how is it spread?</h4><p class="list-leadIn">Giardiasis can be spread by:</p><ul class="bullet-list nolines list-indent"><li>Swallowing <em>Giardia</em> picked up from surfaces (such as bathroom handles, changing tables, diaper pails, or toys) that contain stool from an infected person or animal</li><li>Drinking water or using ice made from water sources where <em>Giardia</em> may live (for example, untreated or improperly treated water from lakes, streams, or wells)</li><li>Swallowing water while swimming or playing in water where <em>Giardia</em> may live, especially in lakes, rivers, springs, ponds, and streams</li><li>Eating uncooked food that contains <em>Giardia</em> organisms</li><li>Having contact with someone who is ill with giardiasis</li><li>Traveling to countries where giardiasis is common</li></ul><p class="list-leadOut">Anything that comes into contact with feces (poop) from infected humans or animals can become contaminated with the <em>Giardia</em> parasite. People become infected when they swallow the parasite. It is not possible to become infected through contact with blood.</p><p><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="symptoms" name="symptoms" title="What are the symptoms of giardiasis?">Â </a></p><h4>What are the symptoms of giardiasis?</h4><p class="list-leadIn"><em>Giardia</em> infection can cause a variety of intestinal symptoms, which include:</p><ul class="bullet-list nolines list-indent"><li>Diarrhea</li><li>Gas or flatulence</li><li>Greasy stool that can float</li><li>Stomach or abdominal cramps</li><li>Upset stomach or nausea</li><li>Dehydration</li></ul><p class="list-leadOut">These symptoms may also lead to weight loss.

Occasionally, symptoms last longer. Medications can help decrease the amount of time symptoms last.</p><p><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="risk" name="risk" title="Who is most at risk of getting giardiasis?">Â </a></p><h4>Who is most at risk of getting giardiasis?</h4><p class="list-leadIn">Though giardiasis is commonly thought of as a camping or backpacking-related disease and is sometimes called "Beaver Fever," anyone can get giardiasis.

Because testing for giardiasis can be difficult, you may be asked to submit several stool specimens collected over several days.</p><p><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="tx" name="tx" title="What is the treatment for giardiasis?">Â </a></p><h4>What is the treatment for giardiasis?</h4><p>Many prescription drugs are available to treat giardiasis. Although the <em>Giardia</em> parasite can infect all people, infants and pregnant women may be more likely to experience dehydration from the diarrhea caused by giardiasis.Â To prevent dehydration, infants and pregnant women should drink a lot of fluids while ill. Dehydration can be life threatening for infants, so it is especially important that parents talk to their health care providers about treatment options for their infants.</p><p><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="child_dx" name="child_dx" title="My child does not have diarrhea, but was recently diagnosed as having &lt;em&gt;Giardia&lt;/em&gt; infection.

My health care provider says treatment is not necessary. Is this correct?</h4><p>Your child does not usually need treatment if he or she has no symptoms. However, there are a few exceptions. If your child does not have diarrhea, but does have other symptoms such as nausea or upset stomach, tiredness, weight loss, or a lack of hunger, you and your health care provider may need to think about treatment. The same is true if many family members are ill, or if a family member is pregnant and unable to take the most effective medications to treat <em>Giardia</em>. Contact your health care provider for specific treatment recommendations.</p><p><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="well" name="well" title="If my water comes from a well, should I have my well water tested?">Â </a></p><h4>If my water comes from a well, should I have my well water tested?</h4><p class="moreon">More on: <a href="/healthywater/drinking/private/wells/disease/giardia.html"><em>Giardia</em> and Well Water Testing</a></p><p><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="prevent" name="prevent" title="What can I do to Prevent and Control giardiasis?">Â </a></p><h4>What can I do to Prevent and Control giardiasis?</h4><p class="list-leadIn">To prevent and control infection with the <em>Giardia</em> parasite, it is important to:</p><ul class="bullet-list nolines list-indent"><li>Practice good hygiene</li><li>Avoid water (drinking or recreational) that may be contaminated</li><li>Avoid eating food that may be contaminated</li><li>Prevent contact and contamination with feces (poop) during sex</li></ul><p class="moreon list-leadOut">More on: <a href="/parasites/giardia/prevent.html">Prevention &amp; Control</a></p><p><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="pets" name="pets" title="Can I get giardiasis from my pet?">Â </a></p><h4>Can I get giardiasis from my pet?</h4><p>The risk of humans acquiring <em>Giardia</em> infection from dogs or cats is small.
