									<p>Anaplasmosis is a tickborne disease caused by the bacterium <em>Anaplasma phagocytophilum.</em> It was previously known as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) and has more recently been called human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA). Anaplasmosis is <a href="/ticks/life_cycle_and_hosts.html">transmitted</a> to humans by tick bites primarily from the <a href="/ticks/geographic_distribution.html#blacklegged">black-legged tick (<em>Ixodes scapularis</em>)</a> and the <a href="/ticks/geographic_distribution.html#western-blacklegged">western black-legged tick (<em>Ixodes pacificus</em>)</a>. Of the four distinct phases in the tick life-cycle (egg, larvae, nymph, adult), nymphal and adult ticks are most frequently associated with transmission of anaplasmosis to humans. Typical <a href="/anaplasmosis/symptoms/index.html">symptoms</a> include: fever, headache, chills, and muscle aches.  Usually, these symptoms occur within 1-2 weeks of a tick bite. Anaplasmosis is initially <a href="/anaplasmosis/symptoms/index.html">diagnosed</a> based on symptoms and clinical presentation, and later confirmed by the use of specialized laboratory tests.  The first line <a href="/anaplasmosis/symptoms/index.html">treatment</a> for adults and children of all ages is doxycycline.  Anaplasmosis and other tickborne diseases can be <a href="/ticks/avoid/on_people.html">prevented.</a></p>
