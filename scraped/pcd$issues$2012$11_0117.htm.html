<h2><a name="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2>
<p><b>Introduction</b><br/>
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder that is associated with 
significant morbidity. Veterans may be at an elevated risk for OSA because of 
increased prevalence of factors associated with the development and progression 
of OSA. The objective of this study was to determine the clinical 
characteristics, comorbidities, polysomnographic findings, and response to 
treatment of veterans with OSA.</p>
<p><b>Methods</b><br/>
We performed a retrospective chart review of 596 patients undergoing 
polysomnography at the Cincinnati Veterans Affairs Medical Center from February 
2005 through December 2007. We assessed potential correlations of clinical data 
with polysomnography findings and response to treatment.</p>
<p><b>Results</b><br/>
Polysomnography demonstrated OSA in 76% of patients; 30% had mild OSA, 23% 
moderate OSA, and 47% severe OSA. Increasing body mass index, neck 
circumference, Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, hypertension, congestive heart 
failure, and type 2 diabetes correlated with increasing OSA severity. Positive 
airway pressure treatment was initiated in 81% of veterans with OSA, but only 
59% reported good adherence to this treatment method. Of the patients reporting 
good adherence, a greater proportion of those with severe OSA (27%) than with 
mild or moderate disease (0%-12%) reported an excellent response to treatment.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b><br/>
The prevalence of metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidities increased with 
increasing OSA severity. Only 59% of treated patients reported good adherence to 
treatment with positive airway pressure, and response to treatment correlated 
with OSA severity.</p>

<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a condition characterized by repeatedly 
interrupted breathing during sleep, occurs frequently in adults (1). The 
prevalence of OSA increases with age and may affect 38% to 68% of people older 
than 60 years (1). Clinical characteristics that predict risk of development and 
progression of OSA include a large neck circumference and male sex. Body mass 
index (BMI) and tonsil size are predictors of OSA severity (2,3). Comorbid 
conditions associated with OSA include hypertension, atrial fibrillation, 
congestive heart failure, stroke, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes 
(2,4,5). Patients cared for by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) are 
predominantly older men with many of these conditions (6). A survey of veterans 
in northeast Ohio using the Cleveland Sleep Habits questionnaire (7) showed that 
46% of the respondents were at high risk for OSA (7). A similar study in San 
Juan, Puerto Rico, showed that 34% of veterans attending ambulatory clinics were 
at high risk for OSA (8).</p>
<p>OSA is diagnosed by polysomnography and measured by the apnea-hypopnea index 
(AHI). An AHI of more than 5 events per hour (9) is diagnosed as OSA. OSA 
severity is stratified according to AHI score. Fewer than 5 events per hour is 
designated as normal, 5 to 14 events per hour as mild OSA, 15 to 30 events per 
hour as moderate OSA, and more than 30 events per hour as severe OSA (9). Once OSA 
is diagnosed, a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) study is often 
performed to determine the optimal positive airway pressure required to reduce 
the AHI and improve oxygenation. The most common treatment for OSA, 
positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment, is frequently initiated to reduce sleep-related 
symptoms. Patients with more sleep-related symptoms appear to receive greater 
benefit from treatment than do patients with fewer sleep-related symptoms (10). 
Despite the availability of numerous types of masks and interfaces, CPAP is 
often poorly tolerated, and it is difficult to predict which patients will 
adhere and respond to treatment (11). The objective of this study was to 
determine the clinical characteristics, comorbidities, polysomnographic 
findings, and response to therapy of veterans with OSA.</p>

<h2><a name="Methods"></a>Methods</h2>
<p>We reviewed the records of 596 patients who underwent polysomnography during 
3 years at the Cincinnati Veteran Affairs Medical Center (VAMC). Patients were 
evaluated on the basis of their AHI, OSA severity, clinical characteristics (eg, 
neck circumference, BMI), comorbidities, and response to treatment. This 
protocol was approved by the research and development committee of the 
Cincinnati VAMC and reviewed by the University of Cincinnati institutional 
review board, which waived the need for consent.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Participant selection </h3>
<p>Health care providers throughout the Cincinnati VAMC referred veterans with 
suspected sleep disorders to our sleep clinic, where a standardized sleep 
evaluation was performed and polysomnography scheduled. We retrospectively 
reviewed the medical records and polysomnography reports of 748 veterans who 
completed evaluation and testing for sleep-disordered breathing in the 
Cincinnati VAMC from February 2005 through December 2007. From this chart 
review, we selected for our study group 596 patients who completed the 
evaluation and polysomnography testing. We excluded 152 patients with previously 
diagnosed OSA who returned for therapeutic (CPAP/bilevel titration) studies and 
patients who did not complete testing, terminated the test prematurely, or 
achieved insufficient or no sleep. All patients who were referred for 
polysomnography completed a pretest assessment and questionnaire with assistance 
from the sleep study technologist. Information abstracted from this 
questionnaire included age, measured weight, self-reported height, smoking 
history, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score (a measure of sleep propensity) 
(12), and self-reported snoring, apneas, and morning headaches.</p>
<p>We used a Sandman Elite sleep system for polysomnography studies (Sandman 
Elite, version 8.0, Nellcor Puritan Bennett [Melville] Ltd, Kanata, Ontario, 
Canada). Monitored channels included bilateral oculograms, 4 
electroencephologram channels, electrocardiogram, bilateral anterior tibialis 
electromyograms (EMG), chin EMG, body position, video channel, PAP level and flow, and snoring microphone. Nasal/oral and PAP 
airflow were measured by thermocouple, thoracic and abdominal respiratory effort 
by piezoelectric method, and oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) by pulse 
oximetry. We analyzed and scored data according to criteria of the American 
Academy of Sleep Medicine (9). We defined apnea as cessation of airflow for at 
least 10 seconds and hypopnea as a reduction in airflow of at least 30% lasting 
at least 10 seconds, accompanied by at least a 4% decrease in oxygen saturation 
(9). Rapid eye movement (REM) rebound was defined as 20% or more of sleep time 
in REM. In many of our polysomnography studies we used a split-night protocol 
consisting of an initial diagnostic study followed by titration of CPAP or 
bilevel treatment on the same night. (CPAP maintains a constant minimal airway 
pressure throughout the respiratory cycle whereas bilevel treatment oscillates 
between a higher inspiratory pressure to maintain airway patency and a lower 
expiratory pressure to facilitate exhalation. Both are forms of positive airway 
pressure.) Patients with OSA who did not complete a split-night protocol because 
of an insufficient number of events, too little sleep, or too little REM sleep 
during the first half of the night returned for a titration study on another 
night.</p>
<p>Abstracted polysomnography data included total sleep time; sleep latency; REM 
latency; percentage of sleep achieved in stages 1, 2, 3-4, and REM; number of 
central, obstructive, and mixed apneas; number of hypopneas; REM-related AHI; 
and minimal SpO<sub>2</sub>. If treatment was initiated, we reviewed these same 
values as well as AHI at optimal treatment pressure. We obtained patient medical 
history and information on comorbid conditions (ie, hypertension, coronary 
artery disease, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary 
hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular accidents, and transient ischemic 
attacks) from the Cincinnati VAMC electronic medical record. We reviewed all 
clinical reports from postpolysomnography encounters to assess the patientâs 
adherence to treatment and response to therapy. We graded adherence according to 
the following criteria: âgood,â patient reported use of positive pressure 
equipment for 3 or more nights weekly; âpartial,â patient reported use of 
equipment for fewer than 3 nights weekly; ânot adherent,â no use of equipment; 
and ânot specified/no data,â patient had not returned to the sleep clinic for 
follow-up or there were no comments regarding adherence in other clinical notes. 
For veterans with good adherence, we graded the response to treatment according 
to the following criteria: âexcellent,â complete or near complete relief of 
pretreatment sleep-related symptoms, greatly improved energy and alertness, and 
more restful sleep; âmoderate,â relief of most sleep-related symptoms but 
persistent daytime somnolence or fatigue and inconsistently restorative sleep; 
âno change,â persistence of nearly all sleep-related symptoms; and ânot 
specified/no data,â patients had not returned to the sleep clinic for follow-up 
or there were no comments regarding sleep-disordered breathing in records of 
other clinical encounters.</p>
<p>Because of the high prevalence of severe OSA, we performed further 
comparisons to determine whether patients with ultrasevere OSA (AHI &gt;60 
events/h, 1 respiratory event/min) could be distinguished from those with less 
severe OSA (AHI 31-60 events/h).</p>
<h3 class="h3">Statistical analysis </h3>
<p>We calculated mean, standard deviation (SD), standard error of the mean, and 
confidence intervals for continuous variables. Differences between the 
categorical OSA groups and continuous variables were analyzed by using 1-way 
ANOVA with the Bonferroni test for multiple comparisons. We calculated 
categorical variables as frequencies or proportions and analyzed them using χ<sup>
2</sup> testing with the Marascuilo procedure for multiple comparisons. We 
defined significant differences as
<i>P</i> &lt; .05. We performed all statistical analyses with GraphPad Prism 5.0 
statistical software (GraphPad, La Jolla, California).</p>

<h2><a name="Results"></a>Results</h2>
<p>Patients were predominantly male (559 of 596 [94%]), with a mean (SD) age of 
56.0 (11.6) years. Polysomnography demonstrated OSA in 76% of patients; 30% had 
mild OSA, 23% moderate OSA, and 47% severe OSA. Increasing BMI, neck 
circumference, ESS scores, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and type 2 
diabetes correlated with increasing OSA severity <a name="table1_up"></a>(<a href="#table1_down">Table 
1</a>).</p>
<p>Among the OSA patients, the REM-related AHI rose and the SpO<sub>2</sub> 
declined as OSA severity increased <a name="table2_up"></a>(<a href="#table2_down">Table 
2</a>).</p>
<p>Treatment was initiated for 81% of the patients with OSA; 73% of patients 
received CPAP and 27% received bilevel therapy. With CPAP, the proportion of 
patients with REM rebound increased with increasing OSA severity; one-third of 
patients with severe OSA experienced REM rebound (Table 2). More than 10% of 
patients did not tolerate CPAP (pulled off the mask during the study or 
requested removal of the mask), and treatment adherence did not vary with OSA 
severity. The AHI declined dramatically with successful CPAP for all patients 
with OSA, and the posttreatment AHI was lower in the mild group compared with 
the severe group. The optimal levels of CPAP and inspiratory and expiratory 
bilevel pressures rose with increasing OSA severity.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Adherence and outcomes </h3>
<p>Follow-up information about adherence to treatment was available for 291 of 
the 368 treated patients (79%). Of the 291, 172 patients (59%) reported using 
their CPAP or bilevel equipment at least 3 nights weekly, and 27 of 100 (27%) 
patients with severe OSA reported an excellent response compared with 0 of 40 
patients with mild OSA <a name="table3_up"></a>(<a href="#table3_down">Table 3</a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3">Ultrasevere and less severe OSA</h3>
<p>Patients with more than 30 AHI events per hour (n = 211) were divided into 
less severe (n = 99) and ultrasevere (n = 112) categories. More patients with 
ultrasevere OSA reported a history of observed apnea events, a higher BMI, and 
concurrent coronary artery disease and pulmonary hypertension than did patients 
with less severe OSA. Although the minimal SpO<sub>2</sub> was less in the 
ultrasevere group, other polysomnographic findings, treatments, adherence, and 
outcomes were similar in the 2 groups.</p>

	<h2><a name="Discussion"></a>Discussion</h2>
<p>In our study group of 596 patients who underwent complete diagnostic 
polysomnography testing, 76% had OSA. Of these, 30% had mild, 23% moderate, and 
47% severe OSA. BMI, neck circumference, and ESS score increased with worsening 
OSA severity, as did cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities. Most patients 
were treated for OSA, but only 59% reported good adherence with positive 
pressure therapy. More adherent patients with severe OSA than with mild or 
moderate disease reported an excellent response to treatment. Finally, despite a 
higher proportion of patients with severe OSA, we were unable to determine 
clinical or polysomnographic features that distinguished less severe OSA from 
ultrasevere OSA.</p>
<p>Previous studies within the VHA have shown that 34% to 47% of veterans 
attending outpatient clinics are at increased risk for OSA (7,8). In 1983, a 
preliminary study of 27 randomly selected inpatients at the San Diego VAMC who 
underwent portable polysomnography monitoring of 4 channels (thoracic and 
abdominal respiratory effort, lower-extremity electromyogram, and wrist 
actigraphy) in their hospital beds demonstrated that 7 (27%) had sleep apnea, 
defined as 30 or more apneas per hour (13). Subsequent studies at the same 
institution using the same study protocol found that 84% of 436 randomly 
selected inpatients had an AHI greater than 5 in 1991, and 53% of 186 inpatients 
had an AHI greater than 15 in 2003 (14,15). In contrast, a review of the first 
117 patients undergoing polysomnography by the same group in the San Diego Sleep 
Disorders Clinic showed that 44% had sleep apnea (16). Approximately one-fourth 
(46 of 192) of Persian Gulf War veterans self-referred to the Comprehensive 
Clinical Evaluation Program at Fort Sam Houston had histories suggesting a sleep 
disorder; polysomnography demonstrated OSA (defined as a respiratory disturbance 
index of ≥15 events/h) in 33% of these veterans (17). Differences in technology, 
study protocols including the tested population, and definition of OSA make it 
difficult to compare these reports with our study, which demonstrated OSA (AHI ≥5 events/h) in 76% of veterans undergoing polysomnography, 47% of whom had 
severe OSA (AHI &gt;30 events/h).</p>
<p>Based on previous estimates of the proportion of the veteran population that 
is at increased risk of OSA (34%-47%) (7,8) and our polysomnography results (76% 
with demonstrated OSA, 47% of whom had severe OSA), approximately 26% to 36% of 
veterans served by the VHA would be diagnosed with OSA, and 12% to 17% would 
have severe OSA if all veterans at increased risk for sleep disordered breathing 
completed diagnostic polysomnography testing. In a review of VHA administrative 
databases from 1998 to 2001, Sharafkhaneh and colleagues (18) found that the 
prevalence of coded and documented diagnosed OSA was 2.9%. Thus, sleep apnea may 
be underrecognized and underdiagnosed in veterans receiving care in the VHA 
system, and possibly only 1 of every 5 to 10 veterans with OSA is diagnosed. 
Prospective, multicenter epidemiologic studies are needed to determine the 
precise prevalence and severity of OSA among veterans served by the VHA.</p>
<p>Previous population-based studies suggest that 15% to 32% of men in the 
general American population have OSA and that the prevalence of severe OSA is 
approximately 5% (1). These prevalence calculations are very similar to our 
estimated prevalence of OSA and severe OSA in the national veteran population, 
26% to 36% and 12% to 17%, respectively. These national studies include people 
aged 20 to 99 and, since the prevalence of OSA appears to begin to increase with 
age in midlife, may not be comparable to the national veteran population (1). 
Furthermore, the veteran population may have a higher prevalence of factors 
associated with the development and progression of OSA, such as excess body 
weight, smoking, alcohol consumption, and nasal congestion (1). Thus, comparison 
of the veteran population with an age-, sex-, and risk-factorâmatched cohort 
from the general American population is required to determine whether the 
prevalence and severity of OSA are the same in both groups.</p>
<p>In our study, BMI, neck circumference, and ESS score correlated positively 
with AHI. Participants in the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) who had an AHI of 
15 or more were significantly more likely to have an increased BMI, neck 
circumference, and breathing-pause frequency (2). The SHHS did find a 
correlation between habitual snoring and loud snoring and AHI of 15 or more, 
which we did not see in our study (2). Of all the patient attributes evaluated 
in the SHHS, self-reported, frequent apneas (&gt;3 nights/wk) occurred most 
frequently among those with an AHI of 15 or more (49%), but this finding alone 
was only minimally predictive of OSA (2). BMI and neck circumference are strong 
predictors of OSA, whereas self-reported apneas, ESS values, and frequent, loud 
snoring predict OSA severity (2,19).</p>
<p>In 118,105 veterans diagnosed with OSA, metabolic and cardiovascular 
comorbidities occurred frequently: diabetes in 32.9%, obesity in 30.5%, 
hypertension in 60.1%, cardiovascular disease in 27.6%, congestive heart failure 
in 13.5%, and cerebrovascular accident in 5.7% (17). In our study, the 
prevalence of hypertension, congestive heart failure, and type 2 diabetes 
correlated with OSA severity. Large studies have shown a positive association 
between hypertension and OSA severity (1,20). In a study of nearly 2,300 people 
in China undergoing polysomnography, AHI was linearly related to systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure up to an AHI of 60 (19). Others have also shown that 
the prevalence of diabetes increases with the severity of OSA (21).</p>
<p>The minimal measured SpO<sub>2</sub> declined with increasing OSA severity. 
Various indices of nocturnal oxygen saturation have been shown to correlate with 
and predict AHI (22,23). Lin and colleagues (23) showed that the oxyhemoglobin 
desaturation index was the most sensitive and specific measure of oxygenation 
for all levels of OSA.</p>
<p>For many patients, apneas and hypopneas can be more prominent during REM 
sleep (24). A Japanese study found that patients with an AHI of 60 or more were 
significantly more likely to have a higher AHI in non-REM sleep than in REM 
sleep, whereas among patients with less severe disease, the relationship was 
reversed (25). Another investigation showed that half of patients with OSA have 
a higher non-REM AHI than REM AHI (26). The REM-related AHI correlated with AHI 
and increased most dramatically when AHI was greater than 60 events per hour.</p>
<p>Our study showed that patients with severe OSA were slightly more likely to 
adhere to CPAP treatment, a finding similar to that of other investigations 
(27,28). In our study, 53% of patients with severe OSA had good adherence to 
treatment, whereas only 39% of those with mild OSA reported using their 
equipment more than 3 nights weekly. Adherence to CPAP use is better in people 
with more daytime sleepiness regardless of OSA severity (10,29). The ESS score, 
a measure of excessive daytime sleepiness, was significantly higher in patients 
with more severe OSA, suggesting that these patients were more symptomatic and 
may have experienced more symptom improvement with treatment. The higher 
proportion of excellent response to treatment among Cincinnati VMAC patients 
with severe OSA corresponds to results of previous studies that found 
significant associations between the resolution of symptoms with CPAP treatment 
and improved treatment adherence (30,31).</p>
<p>This study was a retrospective review of polysomnography studies at a single 
center, the Cincinnati VAMC sleep center. Patients with more severe 
sleep-related symptoms may have been preferentially referred for sleep 
evaluation, resulting in higher prevalence and severity of OSA. Only completed 
diagnostic polysomnography studies were analyzed; including patients who did not 
complete testing and may not have had OSA would reduce the OSA diagnosis rate. 
In most of the patients we studied, we used a split-night polysomnography 
protocol that may have underestimated the presence and severity of OSA. Another 
limitation was the use of self-reporting for adherence assessment. Although 
patientsâ CPAP and bilevel units were examined for the numbers of hours used per 
night, this evaluation was not performed consistently, and there were 
insufficient data for analysis. Finally, the severity of hypertension and 
treatment for hypertension at the time of the polysomnography study were not 
documented. Only the presence or absence of a hypertension diagnosis was noted.</p>
<p>On the basis of our data and on previous surveys of the prevalence of 
patients at high risk for OSA within the VHA, we estimate the prevalence of OSA 
to be 26% to 36% of veterans cared for by the VHA, and the prevalence of severe 
OSA to be 12% to 17%. Metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidities occurred 
frequently in veterans with OSA, and the prevalence of these disorders increased 
with OSA severity. Only 59% of treated patients at the Cincinnati VAMC reported 
good adherence with CPAP treatment, and within this group, response to therapy 
increased as OSA severity worsened.</p>
