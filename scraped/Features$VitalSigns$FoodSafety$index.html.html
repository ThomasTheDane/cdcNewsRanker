In the past few years, large outbreaks of illness caused by <em>Salmonella</em>-contaminated eggs and peanut products have made the headlines. Although many other foodborne illnesses have declined in the past 15 years, <em>Salmonella</em> infections have not declined at all. A new <strong><a href="/vitalsigns/FoodSafety/index.html">Vital Signs report</a></strong> on making our food safer to eat focuses on reducing contamination from <em>Salmonella.</em></p><p>Don't let <em>Salmonella</em> sneak up on you. Seven facts that may surprise youâknow the risks.</p><ol><li><strong>You can get <em>Salmonella</em> from eating a wide variety of foods, not just from eggs and undercooked poultry.</strong> Although poultry and eggs are primary culprits, <em>Salmonella can</em> be found in a variety of foods including ground meat, fruits, vegetablesâeven processed foods such as frozen pot pies. <strong><!-- --></strong></li><li><strong><img alt="Photo: A family eating a meal" class="imageRighty" height="217" src="/features/vitalsigns/foodsafety/foodsafety_b200px.jpg" width="200"/><em>Salmonella</em> illness can sometimes be serious</strong>. In most cases, illness lasts 4â7 days, and most people recover without antibiotic treatment. But, in rare cases, people may become seriously ill. Compared with other foodborne germs, <em>Salmonella</em> is the deadliest. It also causes more hospitalizations as well.</li><li><strong>For every 1 case of <em>Salmonella</em> illness that is confirmed in the laboratory, there are about 30 times more cases of <em>Salmonella</em> illnesses that were <em>not</em> confirmed</strong>.<br/>Most people who get food poisoning usually do not go the doctor, and therefore don't get laboratory confirmation of exactly what made them sick. So <em>Salmonella</em> can cause more illness than you might suspect.</li><li><strong><em>Salmonella</em> illness is more common in the summer</strong>.<br/>Warmer weather gives bacteria more opportunity to contaminate food. When eating outdoors in the summer, either in the backyard or on a picnic, follow these guidelines: <ul><li>Always keep cold foods cold and hot foods hot.</li><li>When you're finished eating, refrigerate leftovers promptly. Don't let food sit out for more than 2 hours. On a hot day (90Â°F or higher), reduce this time to 1 hour.</li><li>Be sure to put perishable items in a cooler or insulated bag.</li></ul></li><li><strong><img alt="Photo: A bot eating a hard-boild egg" class="imageRighty" height="200" src="/features/vitalsigns/foodsafety/foodsafety_d200px.jpg" width="200"/>You can get <em>Salmonella</em> from perfectly normal-looking eggs.<br/></strong>Chicken feces on the outside of egg shells used to be a common cause of <em>Salmonella</em> contamination. To counter that, stringent procedures for cleaning and inspecting eggs were implemented in the 1970s. However, now there's a new cause for concern. An epidemic that started in the 1980s and continues today is due to a type of <em>Salmonella</em> that is <em>inside</em> intact grade A eggs with clean shells. This type of <em>Salmonella</em> can silently infect the ovaries of healthy appearing hens and contaminate the inside of eggs before the shells are formed.</li><li><strong>To avoid <em>Salmonella</em>, you should never eat raw or lightly cooked (runny whites or yolks) eggs.<br/></strong>Cooking reduces the number of <em>Salmonella</em> bacteria present in an egg. However, a lightly cooked egg with a runny egg white or yolk still poses a greater risk than a thoroughly cooked egg. Lightly cooked egg whites and yolks have both caused outbreaks of <em>Salmonella</em> infections.</li><li><strong><em>Salmonella</em> is more dangerous for certain people.<br/></strong>Although anyone can get a <em>Salmonella</em> infection, older adults, infants, and people with impaired immune systems are at increased risk for serious illness. In these people, a relatively small number of <em>Salmonella</em> bacteria can cause severe illness.</li></ol><p><strong><img alt="Photo: A mna cleaning a counter top." class="imageRighty" height="299" src="/features/vitalsigns/foodsafety/foodsafety_e200px.jpg" width="200"/></strong>You can keep you and your family safer by remembering to:</p><ul><li><strong>Clean.</strong> Wash hands, cutting boards, utensils, and countertops.</li><li><strong>Separate.</strong> Keep raw meat, poultry, and seafood separate from ready-to-eat foods.</li><li><strong>Cook.</strong> Use a food thermometer to ensure that foods are cooked to a safe internal temperature: 145Â°F for whole meats (allowing the meat to rest for 3 minutes before carving or consuming), 160Â°F for ground meats, and 165Â°F for all poultry.</li><li><strong>Chill.</strong> Keep your refrigerator below 40Â°F and refrigerate food that will spoil.</li><li><strong>Don't prepare food for others</strong> if you have diarrhea or vomiting.</li><li><strong>Be especially careful</strong> preparing food for children, pregnant woman, those in poor health, and older adults.</li></ul><h3 id="moreInfo">More Information</h3><ul><li><a href="/vitalsigns/FoodSafety/index.html">CDC Vital Signs - Making Food Safer to Eat</a></li><li><a href="/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6022a5.htm?s_cid=mm6022a5_w">Vital Signs: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR)</a></li><li><a href="/foodborneburden">Estimates of Foodborne Illness in the U.S.</a></li><li><a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/salmonellainfections.html" target="_blank">MedlinePlus - Salmonella Infections</a></li><li><a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ecoliinfections.html" target="_blank">MedlinePlus - <em>E.coli</em> Infections</a></li><li><a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/foodsafety.html" target="_blank">MedlinePlus - Food Safety</a></li></ul></div><!-- END mSyndicate --></div><!-- END syndicate --></div>
