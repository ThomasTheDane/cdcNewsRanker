                           Pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, is a prevention option for people who are at high risk of getting HIV. Itâs meant to be used consistently, as a pill taken every day, and to be used with other prevention options such as condoms. Find out if PrEP is right for you.</div>

                  <h4>What is PrEP</h4>
                  <div>
                  <p>“PrEP” stands for <strong>Pr</strong>e-<strong>E</strong>xposure <strong>P</strong>rophylaxis. The word “prophylaxis”  means to prevent or control the spread of an infection or disease. The goal of  PrEP is to prevent HIV infection from taking hold if you are exposed to the  virus. This is done by taking a pill that contains two HIV medications every  day. These are the same medicines used to stop virus growing in people who are  already infected.</p>

                  <h4>Why take PrEP?</h4>

                        <p>The HIV epidemic in the United States is growing. There  are about 50,000 new HIV infections each year. These infections are happening  more often in some groups of people and some areas of the country than in  others<strong>.</strong></p>

                  <h4>Is PrEP a vaccine?</h4>
                   <div class="inner">
                   <p>No. PrEP medication is not injected into the body  and does not work the same way as a vaccine. You will take a pill every day by  mouth. The medication that was shown to be safe and to help block HIV infection  is called “Truvada” (pronounced tru vÃ¡ duh). Truvada is a  combination of two drugs (tenofovir and emtricitabine). These medicines work by  blocking important pathways that the HIV virus uses to set up an infection. If  you take Truvada as PrEP daily, the presence of the medication in your  bloodstream can often stop the HIV virus from establishing itself and spreading  in your body. If you do not take the Truvada pills every day, there may not be  enough medicine in your bloodstream to block the virus. </p>

<h4>Should I consider taking PrEP?</h4>
<div class="inner">
						      <p>PrEP is not for everyone. Doctors prescribe PrEP for  some patients who have a very high risk of coming in contact with HIV by having  unprotected sex with a person who has HIV infection. You should consider PrEP  if you are a man or woman who has sex sometimes without using a condom, especially  if you have a sex partner who you know has HIV infection, if you don’t know  whether your partner has HIV infection but you know they have risks for it (for  example, they inject drugs or are having sex with other people in addition to  you), or if you have recently been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted  infection. If your partner has HIV infection, PrEP may be an option to help  protect you from getting HIV infection while you try to get pregnant, during  pregnancy, or while breastfeeding. </p>

<h4>How well does PrEP work?</h4>
<div class="inner">
<p>PrEP was tested in several large studies with men  who have sex with men, men who have sex with women, and women who have sex with  men. All people in these studies 1) were tested at the beginning of the trial  to be sure that they did not have HIV infection, 2) agreed to take an oral PrEP  tablet daily, 3) received intensive counseling on safe-sex behavior, 4) were tested  regularly for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and 5) were given a  regular supply of condoms.</p>
<p> For several studies, we have results that showed  that PrEP was effective in reducing the risk of getting HIV infection. </p>
<ul class="bulleted-links">
  <li>Among men who have sex with men who were  given PrEP medication to take, overall they were 44% less likely to get HIV infection  than those who took a pill without any PrEP medicine in it. This was an average  that included men who didn’t take the medicine every day and those who did.  Among the men who said they took most of their daily doses, PrEP reduced the  risk of HIV infection by 73% or more, up to 92% for some. </li>
  <li>Among men and women in couples where their  partner had HIV infection and they initially did not (“HIV discordant”  couples), those who received PrEP medication were 75% less likely to become  infected than those who took a pill without any medicine in it. Among those who  said they took most of their daily doses, PrEP reduced the risk of HIV  infection by up to 90%.</li>
  <li>Among men and women who entered the  studies as individuals (not as a couple), PrEP worked for both men and women in  one study where those receiving the medication were 62% less likely to get HIV  infection. For those who said they took most of their daily doses, PrEP reduced  the risk of HIV infection by up to 85%. But in one study, only about 1 in 4  women (&lt;26%) had PrEP medication found in their blood when it was checked  and that study found no protection against HIV infection.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Is PrEP safe?</h4>
<div class="inner">
 <p>The clinical trials also provided safety information  on PrEP. Some people in the trials had early side effects like an upset stomach  or loss of appetite but these were mild and usually went away within the first  month. Some people also had a mild headache. No serious side effects were  observed. You should tell your doctor if these or other symptoms become severe  or do not go away. </p>

<h4>How can I start PrEP?</h4>
<div class="inner">
<p>If you think you may be at high risk for HIV, talk  to your doctor about PrEP. If you and your doctor agree that PrEP might reduce  your risk of getting HIV infection, you will need to come in for a general  health physical, blood tests for HIV, and tests for other infections that you  can get from sex partners. Your blood will also be tested to see if your  kidneys and liver are functioning well. If these tests show that PrEP medicines  are likely to be safe for you to take, and that you might benefit from PrEP,  your doctor may give you a prescription after discussing it with you.</p>
<p> Taking PrEP medicines will require you to follow-up  regularly with your doctor. You will receive counseling on sexual behaviors and  blood tests for HIV infection and to see if your body is reacting well to  Truvada. Your doctor may also check the level of medication in your blood  periodically. You should take your medicine every day as prescribed, and you  will receive advice about ways to help you take it regularly so that it stands  the best chance to help you avoid HIV infection. Tell your doctor if you are  having trouble remembering to take your medicine or if you want to stop PrEP.</p>
