              <h2>Cause</h2>
              <p>Measles is a respiratory disease caused by a virus. The disease of measles and the virus that causes it share the same name. The disease is also called rubeola. Measles virus normally grows in the cells that line the back of the throat and lungs.</p>

              <h2>Symptoms</h2>
              <p>Measles causes fever, runny nose, cough and a rash all over the body. Visit the <a href="signs-symptoms.html">Signs and Symptoms</a> page for more information, and the <a href="photos.html">Photos of Measles</a> page to see pictures of people with the measles rash.</p>

              <h2>Complications</h2>
              <p>About one out of 10 children with measles also gets an ear infection, and up to one out of 20 gets pneumonia. About one out of 1,000 gets encephalitis, and one or two out of 1,000 die. Other rash-causing diseases often confused with measles include roseola (roseola infantum) and <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/rubella/">rubella</a> (German measles).</p>
              <p>While measles is almost gone from the United States, it still kills an estimated 164,000 people each year around the world. Measles can also make a pregnant woman have a miscarriage or give birth prematurely. For more information, visit the <a href="complications.html">Complications</a> page.</p>

              <h2>Transmission</h2>
              <p>Measles spreads through the air by breathing, coughing or sneezing. It is so contagious that any child who is exposed to it and is not immune will probably get the disease.  See the <a href="transmission.html">Transmission</a> page for more information.</p>

              <h2>Measles Incidence</h2>
              <p>Measles is very rare in countries and regions of the world that are able to keep vaccination coverage high. In North and South America, Finland, and some other areas, endemic measles transmission is considered to have been interrupted through vaccination. There are still sporadic cases of measles in the United States because visitors from other countries or US citizens traveling abroad can become infected before or during travel and spread the infection to unvaccinated or unprotected persons.</p>
              <p>Worldwide, there are estimated to be 20 million cases and 164,000 deaths each year. More than half of the deaths occur in India. For more information on measles in the United States and worldwide, visit the <a href="../global-elimination.html">Global Elimination</a> page.</p>

              <h2>Measles History</h2>
              <p>One of the earliest written descriptions of measles as a disease was provided by an Arab physician in the 9th century who described differences between measles and smallpox in his medical notes.</p>
              <p>A Scottish physician, Francis Home, demonstrated in 1757 that measles was caused by an infectious agent present in the blood of patients. In 1954 the virus that causes measles was isolated in Boston, Massachusetts, by John F. Enders and Thomas C. Peebles.  Before measles vaccine, nearly all children got measles by the time they were 15 years of age. Each year in the United States about 450-500 people died because of measles, 48,000 were hospitalized, 7,000 had seizures, and about 1,000 suffered permanent brain damage or deafness. Today there are only about 60 cases a year reported in the United States, and most of these originate outside the country.</p>
