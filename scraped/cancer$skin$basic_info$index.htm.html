<p><em>Cancer</em> is a disease in which cells in the body grow out of control. When cancer starts in the skin, it is called <em>skin cancer.</em></p>

<p>Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States. Some people are at <a href="risk_factors.htm">higher risk</a> of skin cancer than others, but anyone can get it. The most preventable cause of skin cancer is exposure to <a href="what-is-skin-cancer.htm#uv">ultraviolet (UV) light,</a> either from the sun or from artificial sources like tanning beds.</p>
