                        <h2>New Infant Safe Sleep  Recommendations</h2>
					        <p>
				            </p><p><strong><a href="http://www.nichd.nih.gov/news/releases/101811-infant-safe-sleep-recommendations.cfm">CDC supports new recommendations</a></strong> issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). These <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2011/10/12/peds.2011-2284 "><strong>new recommendations</strong></a> aim to reduce   the risk of infant death from SIDS as well as death from known sleep-related   causes. Read the <a href="http://www.healthychildren.org/english/ages-stages/baby/sleep/pages/Preventing-SIDS.aspx "><strong>AAP fact sheet</strong></a> for more   information. </p>
			 
		    <h2>Reducing the Risk</h2>
<p><strong>Always  place babies on their backs to sleep. </strong>Babies who sleep on their  backs are less likely to die of SIDS than babies who sleep on their stomachs or  sides. Placing your baby on his or her back to sleep is the number one way to  reduce the risk of SIDS. </p>
<p> <strong>Use the  back sleep position every time</strong>. Babies who usually sleep  on their backs but who are then placed on their stomachs, such as a nap, are  at very high risk for SIDS. It is important for babies to sleep on their  backs every time, for naps and at night. </p>
					  <p> <strong>Place  your baby on a firm sleep surface, such as a safety-approved crib mattress  covered with a fitted sheet</strong>. Never place a baby to sleep on a pillow, quilt,  sheepskin, or other soft surface. (See <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/info/cribs/index.html"> crib safety information</a> from the  Consumer Product Safety Commission for more information.)</p>

                      <p> <strong>Keep soft  objects, toys, and loose bedding out of your babyâs sleep area.</strong> Donât  use pillows, blankets, quilts, sheepskins, sleep postioner, or pillow-like bumpers in your  babyâs sleep area. Keep all items away from the babyâs face. </p>
					  <p> <strong>Avoid  letting your baby overheat during sleep</strong>. Dress your baby in light  sleep clothing and keep the room at a temperature that is comfortable for an  adult. </p>
						<p> <strong>What does a safe sleep environment look like?</strong><br/>
					  To learn  more about safe sleep environment and reducing the risk of SIDS, check out the  National Institute of Child Health Development (NICHD) publication <a href="http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs/upload/BTS_safe_environment.pdf" target="_blank">What does  a safe sleep environment look like? [PDF  - 194KB]</a>.					  </p>
						<p> <strong>What groups are most at risk for SIDS?</strong><br/>
					  Babies  who are placed to sleep on their stomachs or sides are at higher risk for SIDS  than babies who are placed on their backs to sleep. African-American babies are  more than two times as likely to die of SIDS as Caucasian babies.  American-Indian/Alaska Native babies are nearly three times as likely to die of  SIDS as Caucasian babies. </p>

                        <p> <strong>Will my baby develop flat spots on his or her head from  back sleeping?</strong><br/>
					  For the  most part, flat spots on a babyâs head go away a few months after the baby  learns to sit up. There are other ways to reduce the chance that flat spots  will develop on your babyâs head, such as providing "tummy time" when  your baby is awake and someone is watching. "Tummy time" not only  helps prevent flat spots, but it also helps a babyâs head, neck, and shoulder  muscles get stronger. </p>
