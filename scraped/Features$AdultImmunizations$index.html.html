Immunizations are an important step in preventing illness and staying healthy. Be a positive role model. Get vaccinated.</p><h3>Be an Advocate!</h3><p>Encourage other adults in your family to find out which immunizations they may need to help protect against vaccine-preventable diseases.</p><p>Remind your family, friends, co-workers, and those in the community to get vaccinated each year against seasonal influenza. If they are up-to-date on all of their vaccinations, they protect themselves and those around them, especially babies too young to be vaccinated.</p><div style=" clear: both;">Â </div><h3 id="moreInfo">More Information</h3><ul><li>Adolescent and Adult Quiz: <a href="http://www2.cdc.gov/nip/adultImmSched/">What Vaccines Do YOU Need?</a></li><li><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/spec-grps/adults.htm">Vaccine Information for Adults</a></li><li><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/easy-to-read/adult.html">Adult Immunization Schedule</a></li><li><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/adult-vpd.htm">Learn about vaccine-preventable adult diseases</a></li><li><a href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/content/vaccinations.aspx">Before you travelâ¦</a></li><li>Watch a short video on <a href="http://streaming.cdc.gov/vod.php?id=bc4ea520d308431381d44a5e8cbfa9af20100812135645473">adult vaccines [Video - 3:59]</a></li></ul><div><p id="twentyfourseven">CDC works 24/7 saving lives and protecting people from health threats to have a more secure nation.
