   <h2>How can I reduce my risk for listeriosis?</h2>
                        <p style="margin-top:15px;">The general guidelines recommended  for the prevention of listeriosis are similar to those used to help prevent  other foodborne illnesses, such as <a href="/salmonella/">salmonellosis</a>. In addition, there are  specific recommendations for persons at higher risk for listeriosis. <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/prevention.html#melonsafety">Recommendations</a> related to <em>Listeria</em> in melons, including  cantaloupes, are also included on this page. </p>
<p>There are some general  recommendations on how to prevent an infection with <em>Listeria</em>, and some additional recommendations specifically for  persons who are at higher risk. </p>
                        <a name="generalrecommendations"></a><h3>General recommendations to prevent an  infection with <em>Listeria</em>:</h3>
<h4>FDA recommendations for washing and handling food.</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Rinse</strong> raw produce,  such as fruits and vegetables, thoroughly under running tap water before  eating, cutting, or cooking. Even if the produce will be peeled, it should  still be washed first. </li>
  <li><strong>Scrub</strong> firm produce,  such as melons and cucumbers, with a clean produce brush.</li>
  <li><strong>Dry</strong> the produce  with a clean cloth or paper towel. </li>
  <li><strong>Separate</strong> uncooked meats  and poultry from vegetables, cooked foods, and ready-to-eat foods.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Keep your kitchen and environment cleaner and safer. </h4>
<ul>
  <li>Wash hands, knives, countertops, and cutting boards after handling  and preparing uncooked foods.</li>
  <li>Be aware that <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> can grow in foods in  the refrigerator. Use an appliance thermometer, such as a refrigerator  thermometer, to check the temperature inside your refrigerator. The  refrigerator should be 40Â°F or lower and the freezer 0Â°F or lower. </li>
  <li>Clean up all spills in your refrigerator right awayâespecially  juices from hot dog and lunch meat packages, raw meat, and raw poultry. </li>
  <li>Clean the inside walls and shelves of your refrigerator with hot  water and liquid soap, then rinse. </li>
  </ul>
<h4>Cook meat and poultry  thoroughly.</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Thoroughly cook raw food from animal sources, such as beef, pork,  or poultry to a safe internal temperature. For a list of recommended  temperatures for meat and poultry, visit the <a href="http://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/charts/mintemp.html">safe minimum cooking temperatures chart at FoodSafety.gov.</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Store foods safely. </h4>

											</div>
										</div>
									</div>
								
<ul>
  <li>Use precooked or ready-to-eat food as soon as you can. Do not  store the product in the refrigerator beyond the use-by date; follow USDA  refrigerator storage time guidelines: 
    <ul>
      <li>Hot Dogs â        store opened package no longer than 1 week and unopened package no longer        than 2 weeks in the refrigerator. </li>
      <li>Luncheon and Deli Meat â store        factory-sealed, unopened package no longer than 2 weeks. Store opened        packages and meat sliced at a local deli no longer than 3 to 5 days in        the refrigerator. Â </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  <li>Divide leftovers into shallow containers to promote rapid, even  cooling. Cover with airtight lids or enclose in plastic wrap or aluminum foil.  Use leftovers within 3 to 4 days. </li>
  </ul>
<h4>Choose safer foods. </h4>
<ul>
  <li>Do not drink <a href="/foodsafety/rawmilk/raw-milk-index.html">raw (unpasteurized) milk</a>, and do  not eat foods that have unpasteurized milk in them.</li>
  <li>Find more specific  information about this topic on the <a href="/foodsafety/specific-foods/listeria-and-food.html"><em>Listeria</em> and Food</a> web page.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recommendations for persons at higher  risk, such as pregnant women, persons with weakened immune systems, and older adults in  addition to the recommendations listed above, include:</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top:15px;">Meats </h4>
<ul>
  <li>Do not eat hot dogs, luncheon meats,  cold cuts, other deli meats (e.g., bologna), or fermented or dry sausages  unless they are heated to an internal temperature of 165°F or until steaming  hot just before serving.</li>
  <li>Avoid getting fluid from hot dog and  lunch meat packages on other foods, utensils, and food preparation surfaces,  and wash hands after handling hot dogs, luncheon meats, and deli meats. </li>
  <li>Pay attention to labels. Do not eat refrigerated pÃ¢tÃ© or meat  spreads from a deli or meat counter or from the refrigerated section of a  store. Foods that do not need refrigeration, like canned or shelf-stable pÃ¢tÃ©  and meat spreads, are safe to eat. Refrigerate after opening. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Soft Cheeses </h4>
<ul>
  <li>Do not eat soft cheese such as feta,  queso blanco, queso fresco, brie, Camembert, blue-veined, or panela (queso  panela) unless it is labeled as made with pasteurized milk. Make sure the label  says, "MADE WITH PASTEURIZED MILK."
    <ul>
      <li>Be aware that Mexican-style cheeses  made from pasteurized milk, such as queso fresco, likely contaminated during  cheese-making, have caused <em>Listeria</em> infections. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
<h4>Seafood </h4>
<ul>
  <li>Do not eat refrigerated smoked  seafood, unless it is contained in a cooked dish, such as a casserole, or  unless it is a canned or shelf-stable product. </li>
  <li>Refrigerated smoked seafood,  such as salmon, trout, whitefish, cod, tuna, and mackerel, is most often  labeled as "nova-style," "lox," "kippered,"  "smoked," or "jerky." 
    <ul>
      <li>These fish are typically found in the  refrigerator section or sold at seafood and deli counters of grocery stores and  delicatessens.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>  Canned and shelf stable tuna, salmon, and other fish products are safe to eat. 
  </li>
</ul>

                        <h3>Safety tips for eating melons</h3>
                        <p style="margin-top:15px;"><strong>Get specific safety information  about the <em>Listeria</em> outbreak in cantaloupes <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/index.html">here</a>.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <h4><strong>Follow this general FDA advice for melon safety:</strong></h4>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Consumers and food preparers  should wash their hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds <em>before</em> and <em>after</em> handling any whole melon, such as cantaloupe, watermelon, or  honeydew.  </li>
                          <li>Scrub the surface of  melons, such as cantaloupes, with a clean produce brush under running water and dry them with a  clean cloth or paper towel before cutting. Be sure that your scrub brush is sanitized after each  use, to avoid transferring bacteria between melons.</li>
                          <li>Promptly consume cut melon or refrigerate promptly. Keep your cut melon refrigerated at, or less than 40 degrees F       (32-34 degrees F is best), for no more than 7 days.  </li>
                          <li>Discard cut melons left at room temperature       for more than 4 hours.</li>
                        </ul>
