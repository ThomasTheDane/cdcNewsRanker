But your care routine should travel with you, especially if you have diabetes.</p><p>Meals away from home, changes in how much physical activity you get, and differences in time zones as you travel can affect how well you manage diabetes. Use this time to be refreshed, lose the stress, and be open to healthy habits. Before you hit the road, review these tips for taking care of yourself.</p><h3><img alt="Photo: Hat, sunglasses and suitcase" class="stroke righty" height="200" src="/features/diabetesandtravel/diabetesandtravel_b200px.jpg" width="200"/>Don't Forget Your Medication</h3><ul><li>Pack twice the amount of diabetes supplies you expect to need, in case of travel delays.</li><li>Keep snacks, glucose gel, or tablets with you in case your blood glucose drops.</li><li>Make sure you keep your health insurance card and emergency phone numbers handy, including your doctor's name and phone number.</li><li>Carry medical identification that says you have diabetes.</li><li>Keep time zone changes in mind so you'll know when to take medication.</li><li>If you use insulin, make sure you also pack a glucagon emergency kit.</li><li>Have all syringes and insulin delivery systems (including vials of insulin) clearly marked with the pharmaceutical preprinted label that identifies the medications.
