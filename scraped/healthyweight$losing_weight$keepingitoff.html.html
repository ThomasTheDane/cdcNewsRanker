In studies of people who have lost weight and kept it off for at least a year, most continued to eat a diet lower in calories as compared to their pre-weight loss diet.<sup>2</sup> For more suggestions regarding a healthful diet, visit <a href="/healthyweight/healthy_eating/index.html">Healthy Eating for a Healthy Weight</a>.</li><li><strong>Keep your eating patterns consistent.</strong> Follow a healthy eating pattern regardless of changes in your routine. Plan ahead for weekends, vacations, and special occasions. By making a plan, it is more likely you'll have healthy foods on hand for when your routine changes.</li><li><strong>Eat breakfast every day.</strong> Eating breakfast is a common trait among people who have lost weight and kept it off. Eating a healthful breakfast may help you avoid getting "over-hungry" and then overeating later in the day.</li></ul><p class="topOPage"><a href="/healthyweight/losing_weight/keepingitoff.html">Top of Page</a></p><h3><strong><img alt="photo of woman walking dogs" border="1" class="righty mobileHide" height="218" hspace="5" src="/healthyweight/images/dog_walking.jpg" vspace="5" width="250"/></strong><a id="Be Active" name="Be Active"><!-- --></a>Be Active</h3><ul class="WHBulletsOneLevel"><li><strong>Get daily physical activity.</strong> People who have lost weight and kept it off typically engage in 60â90 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity most days of the week while not exceeding calorie needs. This doesn't necessarily mean 60â90 minutes at one time. It might mean 20â30 minutes of physical activity three times a day. For example, a brisk walk in the morning, at lunch time, and in the evening. Some people may need to talk to their healthcare provider before participating in this level of physical activity.</li></ul><p class="topOPage"><a href="/healthyweight/losing_weight/keepingitoff.html">Top of Page</a></p><h3><a id="Stay on Course" name="Stay on Course"><!-- --></a>Stay on Course</h3><ul class="WHBulletsOneLevel"><li><strong>Monitor your diet and activity.</strong> Keeping a food and physical activity journal can help you track your progress and spot trends. For example, you might notice that your weight creeps up during periods when you have a lot of business travel or when you have to work overtime. Recognizing this tendency can be a signal to try different behaviors, such as packing your own healthful food for the plane and making time to use your hotel's exercise facility when you are traveling. Or if working overtime, maybe you can use your breaks for quick walks around the building.</li><li><strong>Monitor your weight</strong>. Check your weight regularly. When managing your weight loss, it's a good idea to keep track of your weight so you can plan accordingly and adjust your diet and exercise plan as necessary. If you have gained a few pounds, get back on track quickly.</li><li><strong><img alt="photo of a couple playing tennis" border="1" class="righty mobileHide" height="168" hspace="5" src="/healthyweight/images/tennis_couple.jpg" vspace="5" width="250"/>Get support from family, friends, and others.</strong> People who have successfully lost weight and kept it off often rely on support from others to help them stay on course and get over any "bumps." Sometimes having a friend or partner who is also losing weight or maintaining a weight loss can help you stay motivated.</li></ul><h2>Want to learn more?</h2><p><strong><a class="mobileHide" href="/healthyweight/losing_weight/eating_habits.html">Improving Your Eating Habits</a> <a data-mobilize-url="true" href="/healthyweight/losing_weight/eating_habits.html" style="display:none;">Improving Your Eating Habits</a><br/></strong> Your eating habits may be leading to weight gain; for example, eating too fast, always clearing your plate, eating when you not hungry and skipping meals (or maybe just breakfast).</p><p><strong><a class="mobileHide" href="/healthyweight/physical_activity/index.html">Physical Activity for a Healthy Weight</a> <a data-mobilize-url="true" href="/healthyweight/physical_activity/index.html" style="display:none;">Physical Activity for a Healthy Weight</a></strong><br/>Regular physical activity is important for good health, and it's especially important if you're trying to lose weight or to maintain a healthy weight.</p><h2>References</h2><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.nwcr.ws/default.htm">National Weight Control Registry</a>* The National Weight Control Registry (NWCR) was developed to identify and investigate the characteristics of individuals who have succeeded at long-term weight loss.
