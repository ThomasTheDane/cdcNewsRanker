															<p>Influenza (flu) is a contagious respiratory illness caused by <a href="/flu/about/viruses/index.htm">influenza viruses</a>. It can cause mild to severe illness. Serious outcomes of flu infection can result in hospitalization or death. Some people, such as older people, young children, and people with <a href="/flu/about/disease/high_risk.htm">certain health conditions</a>, are at high risk for serious flu complications. The best way to prevent the flu is by getting <strong>vaccinated</strong> each year.</p><p>The <a href="/flu/about/season/upcoming.htm">upcoming season's</a> flu vaccine will protect against the influenza viruses that research indicates will be most common during the season.
