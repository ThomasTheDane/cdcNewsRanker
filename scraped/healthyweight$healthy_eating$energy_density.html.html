Do you still feel hungry and not satisfied after eating? Or have you avoided trying to lose weight because you're afraid of feeling hungry all the time? If so, you are not alone. Many people throw in the towel on weight loss because they feel deprived and hungry when they eat less. But there is another way. Aim for a slow, steady weight loss by decreasing calorie intake while maintaining an adequate nutrient intake and increasing physical activity. You can cut calories without eating less nutritious food. The key is to eat foods that will fill you up without eating a large amount of calories.</p><h2>If I cut calories, won't I be hungry?</h2><p>Research shows that people get full by the <em>amount of food</em> they eat, not the <em>number of calories</em> they take in. You can cut calories in your favorite foods by lowering the amount of fat and or increasing the amount of fiber-rich ingredients, such as vegetables or fruit.</p><p>Let's take macaroni and cheese as an example. The original recipe uses whole milk, butter, and full-fat cheese. This recipe has about 540 calories in one serving (1 cup).</p><div align="center"><img alt="photo of macaroni and cheese with 540 calories" border="0" height="200" src="/healthyweight/images/mac_n_cheese_540.jpg" vspace="10" width="300"/></div><h2>Here's how to remake this recipe with fewer calories and less fat:</h2><ul class="WHBulletsOneLevel"><li>Use 2 cups non-fat milk instead of 2 cups whole milk.</li><li>Use 8 ounces light cream cheese instead of 21â4 cups full-fat cheddar cheese.</li><li>Use 1 tablespoon butter instead of 2 or use 2 tablespoons of soft trans-fat free margarine.</li><li>Add about 2 cups of fresh spinach and 1 cup diced tomatoes (or any other veggie you like).</li></ul><p>Your redesigned mac and cheese now has 315 calories in one serving (1 cup). You can eat the same amount of mac and cheese with 225 fewer calories.</p><div align="center"><img alt="photo of macaroni and cheese with 315 calories" border="0" height="200" src="/healthyweight/images/mac_n_cheese_315.jpg" vspace="10" width="300"/></div><h2>What foods will fill me up?</h2><p>To be able to cut calories without eating less and feeling hungry, you need to replace some higher calorie foods with foods that are lower in calories and fat and will fill you up. In general, this means foods with lots of water and fiber in them. The chart below will help you make smart food choices that are part of a healthy eating plan.</p><table><tbody><tr><th scope="column" valign="top" width="50%">These foods will fill you up with less calories.

This usually means eating too many calories. But, not all large portions are created equal. Larger portions of water- and fiber-rich foods, like fruits, vegetables, and broth-based soups, can fill you up with less calories. Start with an appetizer. Research shows that if you eat a low-calorie appetizer before a meal, you will eat fewer total calories during the meal. Start your meals with a broth-based soup or a green salad without a large amount of cheese, or croutons.</p><p>For more on portion sizes, see <a class="mobileHide" href="/healthyweight/healthy_eating/portion_size.html">How to Avoid Portion Size Pitfalls to Help Manage Your Weight</a><a data-mobilize-url="true" href="/healthyweight/healthy_eating/portion_size.html" style=" display: none;">How to Avoid Portion Size Pitfalls to Help Manage Your Weight</a>.</p><h2>Fruits and veggies: keep it simple!</h2><p>Most fruits and veggies are low-calorie and will fill you up, but the way you prepare them can change that. Breading and frying, and using high-fat creams or butter with vegetables and fruit will add extra calories. Try steaming vegetables and using spices and low-fat sauces for flavor. And enjoy the natural sweetness of raw fruit.</p><p>For more on fruits and vegetables, see <a class="mobileHide" href="/healthyweight/healthy_eating/fruits_vegetables.html">How to Use Fruits and Vegetables to Help Manage Your Weight</a> <a data-mobilize-url="true" href="/healthyweight/healthy_eating/fruits_vegetables.html" style=" display: none;">How to Use Fruits and Vegetables to Help Manage Your Weight</a> .</p><h2>What about beverages?</h2><p>While drinking beverages is important to good health, they don't help you feel full and satisfied the way food does. Choose drinks without calories, like water, sparkling water, or unsweetened iced tea. Drink fat-free or low-fat milk instead of 2% or whole milk.</p><p>For more on drinks, see <a class="mobileHide" href="/healthyweight/healthy_eating/drinks.html">Rethink Your Drink</a> <a data-mobilize-url="true" href="/healthyweight/healthy_eating/drinks.html" style=" display: none;">Rethink Your Drink</a>.</p><p class="topOPage"><a href="/healthyweight/healthy_eating/energy_density.html">Top of Page</a></p><p><!-- --></p><hr/><p><!-- --></p></div></div>
