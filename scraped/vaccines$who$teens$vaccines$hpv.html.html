       <p>HPV vaccines protect against Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and the  diseases that are caused by HPV.</p>
       <p>HPV vaccination is recommended for preteen girls and boys at age 11 or 12 years.  If a teenager or young adult (age 13 through 26 years old) has not gotten any or all of the HPV shots when they were younger, they should ask their doctor about getting them now.</p>
       <p>Preteens and teens should get all 3 doses of an HPV vaccine long before their first sexual contact, so they have time to develop protection from the vaccine.  This  is also the age when the vaccine will work the best since preteens have a  better immune response from the vaccine than older teens.</p>
       <p>There are two different HPV vaccines (Cervarix® or Gardasil®) that can be given to girls and young women. Only one HPV vaccineâGardasil®âcan be given to boys and young men.  Both Cervarix and Gardasil protects against HPV types that cause most cervical cancer and have been shown to prevent cervical cancer. Gardasil has been studied and shown to protect against cervical, anal, vaginal and vulvar cancers.  Gardasil also protects against HPV types that cause most genital warts and has been shown to prevent genital warts.</p>
       <p>To learn more about this vaccine, see <a href="/vaccines/vpd-vac/hpv/vac-faqs.htm">HPV Vaccine - Questions &amp; Answers</a>.</p>
       <h3>How Many Shots and When?</h3>
       <p>HPV vaccine is given in 3 shots over 6 months. The second shot is given 1 or 2 months after the first, and the third shot is given 6 months after the first shot. For  the best protection, it is very important to complete all of the shots long before sexual activity begins. To learn about who should and should not get this vaccine, when they should be vaccinated, and the risks and benefits of this vaccine, read the two <a href="/vaccines/hcp/vis/index.html">HPV vaccine information statements</a>.</p>
       <h2 class="special_hdr">The Disease: Human Papillomavirus </h2>
       <p>Human Papillomavirus (pronounced pap-ah-LO-mah-VYE-rus), also known as HPV, is a very common virus that is spread by skin-to-skin contact during any type of sexual activity with another person. HPV infection is common in people in their teens and early 20s.</p>
       <p>There are many different types of HPV. Some types can cause cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancer in women and penile cancer in men.  These HPV types can also cause anal cancer and some head and neck cancers in both women and men. Other types of HPV can cause genital warts in both women and men. For more details, see <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hpv/WhatIsHPV.html">What is HPV?</a></p>
       <p>Genital <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/HPV/STDFact-HPV.htm">human papillomavirus (HPV</a>)  is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States. About 79  million Americans, most in their late teens and early 20s, are infected with  HPV. About 14 million people become newly infected each year. HPV is so common  that nearly all sexually active men and women get it at some point in their  lives.</p>
       <p>Each  year United States, about 19,000 cancers caused by HPV occur in women and  cervical cancer is the most common. Every year, about 12,000 women are  diagnosed with cervical cancer, and about 4,000 women die from it in the United  States.[<a href="#f1">1</a>] About 8,000 cancers caused by HPV occur each year in men in  the United States and oropharyngeal cancers are the most common.</p>
