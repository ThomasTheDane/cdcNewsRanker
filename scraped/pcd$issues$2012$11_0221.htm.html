<h2><a name="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2>
<p><b>Introduction</b><br/>
Physical activity helps diabetic older adults who have physical impairments or comorbid 
conditions to control their disease. To enable state planners to select 
physical activity programs for these adults, we calculated synthetic 
state-specific estimates of inactive older adults with diabetes, categorized by 
defined health status groups.</p>
<p><b>Methods</b><br/>
Using data from the 2000 through 2009 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) 
and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), we calculated 
synthetic state-specific estimates of inactive adults with diabetes who were 
aged 50 years or older for 5 mutually exclusive health status groups: 1) 
homebound, 2) frail (functional difficulty in walking one-fourth mile, climbing 
10 steps, standing for 2 hours, and stooping, bending, and kneeling), 3) 
functionally impaired (difficulty in 1 to 3 of these functions), 4) having 1 or 
more comorbid conditions (with no functional impairments), and 5) healthy (no 
impairments or comorbid conditions). We combined NHIS regional proportions for 
the health status groups of inactive, older diabetic adults with BRFSS data of 
older diabetic adults to estimate state-specific proportions and totals.</p>
<p><b>Results</b><br/>
State-specific estimates of health status groups among all older adults ranged from 2.2% to 3.0% for 
homebound, 5.8% to 8.8% for frail, 20.1% to 26.1% for impaired, 34.9% to 43.7% 
for having comorbid conditions, and 4.0% to 6.9% for healthy; the remainder were 
older active diabetic adults. Except for the 
homebound, the percentages in these health status groups varied significantly by 
region and state.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b><br/>
These state-specific estimates correspond to existing physical 
activity programs to match certain health status characteristics of groups and 
may be useful to program planners to meet the needs of inactive, older diabetic 
adults.</p>

<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Type 2 diabetes is a major cause of illness and death in the United States, 
especially among older adults, resulting in human and economic costs (1). In 
2010, a total of 10.9 million Americans aged 65 years or older had either diagnosed or 
undiagnosed diabetes (1). Among these older adults, approximately 390,000 new 
diabetes cases were diagnosed in 2010 (1), and diagnosed diabetes cases will 
likely increase to 26.7 million in 2050 from 6.3 million in 2005 (2).</p>
<p>Adults with diabetes are at 1.8 to 2.4 times greater risk of various forms of 
disability than their nondiabetic counterparts (3). Older adults with diabetes 
are more likely than those without the disease to have less muscle strength, poorer muscle 
quality, and accelerated muscle loss (4). Older diabetic adults may respond 
favorably to exercise programs that improve glycemic control (5,6). Among 
older diabetic adults, resistance training can improve muscle 
strength and glycemic control (7,8). In addition, resistance training can 
prevent or delay the development of sarcopenia and osteoporosis and improve 
functional capacity in tasks of daily living among older adults with diabetes 
(6).</p>
<p>Older diabetic adults are more likely to have a sedentary lifestyle (9) and 
are less likely to comply with physical activity recommendations (10). A 
recently developed <i>Reference Guide of Physical Activity for Older Adults</i> 
(PARG) identifies and promotes physical activity programs for older adults (11) 
whose health status ranges from homebound to healthy.</p>
<p>Our objective was to provide state-specific estimates of inactive, older diabetic 
adults, categorized by defined health status groups. Knowing 
state-specific proportions in these groups may help planners select physical 
activity programs for their states (11).</p>

<h2><a name="Methods"></a>Methods</h2>
<p>Using cross-sectional data from the 2000 through 2009 National Health 
Interview Survey (NHIS), we identified health status categories to correspond to 
the health status groups defined by the PARG (11) (Box). Health status data for 
these categories are unavailable in the 2000 through 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor 
Surveillance System (BRFSS); therefore, we applied the NHIS regional estimates 
of the health status categories among inactive, older, diabetic adults to 
state-specific BRFSS estimates of older diabetic adults to create state 
estimates for each health status group.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Data sources</h3>
<p>NHIS and BRFSS conduct annual nationally representative surveys of the health 
of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population. NHIS incorporates a 
household interview in which trained staff annually visit approximately 35,000 
households containing approximately 87,500 people (www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/about 
nhis.htm). The response rates for its sample adult questionnaire were 72.1% in 
2000 and 65.4% in 2009.</p>
<p>BRFSS is a state-based telephone survey of more than 350,000 adults 
(www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.htm#content_area). In 2000, overall response rates 
ranged from 28.8% to 71.8% (median, 48.9%) and cooperation rates from 35.5% to 
77.7% (median, 53.2%) (12). In 2009, response rates ranged from 19.2% to 61.8% 
(median, 34.9%) and cooperation rates from 55.5% to 88.0% (median, 75.0%) (13).</p>

<p>From the NHIS data, we identified inactive older diabetic adults as those 
aged 50 or older who had been told they had diabetes and indicated they had 
never engaged or were unable to engage in leisure-time moderate or vigorous 
activities and categorized them by US census region (Northwest, Midwest, South, and 
West). We grouped respondents by their difficulty in performing the following 6 
functions: walking one-fourth mile; climbing up 10 steps; standing for 2 hours; 
stooping, bending, or kneeling; reaching above their head; and lifting or 
carrying 10 pounds. Because few respondents had difficulty with reaching, 
lifting, or carrying, we defined 2 of our health status groups on the basis of the 
respondents’ reported difficulty with only the remaining 4 functions. Using the 
most restrictive health status group (homebound) as a starting point, we 
assigned each respondent to only 1 of the 5 health status groups (Box).</p>

<p>We calculated synthetic state-specific estimates of older, physically inactive 
diabetic adults in each health status group by multiplying the region-specific 
proportion of each health status group (2000-2009 NHIS) by the state-specific 
proportion of older diabetic adults (2000-2009 BRFSS).</p>
<p>To estimate the standard error of these state-specific synthetic proportions, 
we applied a simple exact formula for the variance of each proportion (14). The 
final state-specific synthetic proportions do not total 100% because the 
estimates represent only the BRFSS values for inactive diabetic adults. The 
remainder would represent active diabetic adults from BRFSS.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Statistical analysis</h3>
<p>We conducted all analyses using SAS-callable SUDAAN version 9.1 (RTI 
International, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina) and accounted for the 
complex survey design, nonresponse, and weighting to represent the US 
population. National proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the 5 health 
status groups were stratified by the 4 census regions. We calculated nonoverlapping 95% confidence intervals to determine 
whether proportion estimates 
among regions and states differed (15).</p>

<h2><a name="Results"></a>Results</h2>
<p>BRFSS percentage distributions by age and sex resembled those of NHIS for 
similar years but differed by education and race<a name="table1_up"></a> (<a href="#table1_down">Table</a>). 
In the 2000 through 2009 NHIS, the overall percentage of inactive older diabetic 
adults who were homebound was approximately 3% (95% CI, 3.4% (95% CI, 2.9%-3.9%); frail, 9.6% (95% CI, 
8.9%-10.3%); impaired, 29.8% (95% CI, 28.7%-30.9%); having a comorbid condition, 
50.5% (95% CI, 49.4%-51.8%); and healthy, 6.7% (95% CI, 6.1%-7.3%).</p>
<p>The NHIS regional percentages in the health status groups varied significantly for 
the frail, people with comorbid conditions, and the healthy (Figure 1). 
Specifically, the percentages for the frail status ranged from 8% in the 
Northeast to 11% in the South. Forty-nine percent in the South had at least 1 
comorbid condition, compared with 55% in the Northeast. The percentage of the 
healthy ranged from 5% in the Midwest to 9% in the West.</p>

	<h2><a name="Discussion"></a>Discussion</h2>
<p>This study provides the first set of state-specific estimates of the 
percentages and the number of inactive, older, diabetic adults in 5 health 
status groups who may benefit from physical activity programs. These estimates 
may facilitate planning of physical activity programs for diabetic older adults 
with varying functional health status (11).</p>
<p>The highest percentage of the homebound and the frail corresponds with higher 
diagnosed diabetes rates in Southern states (16), and the highest percentage of 
the healthy corresponds with lower diagnosed diabetes rates in Western states 
(16). Our estimates may prove valuable to state planners because the functional 
burden among older adults with diabetes is greater than that for those without 
diabetes (17). People with diabetes in the United States are 2 to 3 times more 
likely than older, nondiabetic adults to have various forms of disability, 
including reduced lower-extremity mobility and reduced general physical 
activities (3). Followed prospectively, older diabetic adults have a 42% higher 
risk for developing disability than older nondiabetic adults (18). Diabetes 
often increases the risk for many other comorbid conditions (19) that may lead 
to future declines in physical function (18,20-22) and poorer health-related 
quality of life (23).</p>
<p>Physical activity programs can help older diabetic adults by improving 
glycemic control (24,25), which reduces the development of microvascular and 
other complications (5,25) and other comorbid conditions such as high blood 
pressure and dyslipidemia (5,25). Appropriate physical activity programs can 
restore function among homebound, frail, and impaired adults; control comorbid 
conditions; and help adults who have diabetes but are otherwise healthy to 
resist progression to a more severe health status. Recent guidelines for older 
adults call for individualized patient care and education, the prevention and 
control of cardiovascular risk factors, and screening for combinations of comorbid conditions, while also regulating glycemic status to prevent and 
control microvascular complications (26). These guidelines may require balancing 
glycemic targets, life expectancy, functional status, and patient preferences. 
Recognizing the proportion and number of older diabetic adults in each of the 5 
health status groups is the first step toward devising strategies to prevent 
worsening and perhaps to improve their health status.</p>
<p>Our state-specific synthetic estimates for the 5 health status groups are, to 
our knowledge, the first to correspond with the interventions in the PARG (11). 
Planners may also choose from other physical activity programs to balance the 
proportion and the total number of adults in each health status group against 
implementation needs and costs. For example, programs for the few homebound or 
frail adults will likely require more expensive trained staff to focus on 
improving and preserving physical function and range of motion; the homebound 
will likely require a program delivered in their homes, whereas the frail often 
need transportation to a facility where a program is held. Impaired adults may be 
able to use their own transportation to get to a community program facility. 
Adults who have comorbid conditions may require monitoring to avoid complications from physical activity programs. For 
example, older diabetic adults who use beta blockers to control hypertension may 
be less attentive to the symptoms of hypoglycemia than those not taking such 
medications, and their muted exercise heart rate response could lead to 
overexertion if they attempt to meet a traditional target heart rate applicable to 
healthy older adults (27). Diabetic adults who are otherwise healthy should be 
encouraged to be active to improve glycemic control, to avoid hypoglycemia, and 
to maintain physical function (5,24). Program planners should consider these and 
many other factors identified in the PARG to deliver safe and successful 
programs (11) for specific health status groups of inactive, older diabetic 
adults.</p>
<p>Our study had several limitations. We used the statistically conservative 
method of nonoverlapping confidence intervals to determine significance and 
assumed, within region, that states did not vary in their proportions of 
inactive, older, diabetic adults by specific health status group. This 
conservative approach has the advantage of partially controlling for multiple 
comparisons. We used self-report items of impairment and disability from NHIS 
rather than a detailed geriatric assessment protocol (28) that might better 
ascertain each health status. Because we used self-report for both health status 
groups and physical inactivity, the study’s exposure (physical inactivity) and 
outcome (health status groups) are subject to misclassification. The outcome was 
not available in representative data sets. We also operationally defined the 5 
health status groups primarily to correspond to terms found in the PARG (11). 
Some of the terms, such as “frail,” are hard to define conceptually or 
operationally and are subject to various interpretations (29). Moreover, we did 
not replicate the multiple categories of disability recently outlined by Kalyani 
and colleagues (3), who also used NHIS data. They analyzed all people with 
diabetes, regardless of activity, which ruled out a comparison with our analyses 
of people with diabetes who were inactive. Another limitation is that we did not 
identify separate health status groups for the roughly 1 in 4 physically active, 
older diabetic adults. However, their need for physical activity programs is not 
as pressing as for the remaining inactive, older diabetic adults because the 
combined proportion of the homebound and the frail was higher for the inactive, 
12.9% (homebound + frail = 3.3% + 9.6%, respectively), than for the active, 1.8% 
(homebound + frail = 0.5% + 1.3%, respectively). Nonetheless, active older 
adults with diabetes may benefit from a formal physical activity program. 
Lastly, we did not adjust our estimates for age or any other variable that might 
have produced some of the regional variation in our estimates because our goal 
was to present data for health status group by state. Age and other factors that 
differ among states might change the size of our estimates. However, because 
we stratified our analyses and presented data for only people who were 
physically inactive, we did reduce regional variation in health status groups.</p>
<p>In summary, among older, physically inactive, diabetic adults, the homebound, 
the frail, and the otherwise healthy were less common than those who were 
impaired or who had comorbid conditions. Tailored physical activity programs 
have much to offer older, physically inactive, diabetic adults. State program 
planners may use these estimates to select physical activity programs for each 
kind of health status group to enhance diabetes control and to prevent adverse 
health outcomes that lead to progressively worse impairment. Making such programs 
available may help to control the preventable burden of diabetes that is 
otherwise expected to grow unabated with the anticipated expansion of the older 
adult diabetic population. Because of this expansion, we anticipate that these 
state-level numbers may also change; therefore, future studies may investigate 
changes in these estimates as well as urban-rural and racial differences that 
may exist in health status groups among the states.</p>
