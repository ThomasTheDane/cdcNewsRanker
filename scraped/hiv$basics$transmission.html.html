                  <h4>How is HIV passed from one person to another?</h4>
                  <div>
<p>Only certain fluidsâblood, semen (<em>cum</em>), pre-seminal fluid (<em>pre-cum</em>), rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milkâfrom an HIV-infected person can transmit HIV. These fluids must come in contact with a mucous membrane or damaged tissue or be directly injected into the bloodstream (from a needle or syringe) for transmission to possibly occur. Mucous membranes can be found inside the rectum, the vagina, the opening of the penis, and the mouth. </p><br/>

<p>In the United States, HIV is spread mainly by</p>

<ul class="bulleted-links">
	<li>Having unprotected sex (sex without a condom) with someone who has HIV. 
    		<ul>
            		<li>Anal sex is the highest-risk sexual behavior. Receptive anal sex (bottoming) is riskier than insertive anal sex (topping).</li>
                    <li>Vaginal sex is the second highest-risk sexual behavior.</li>
                    <li>Having multiple sex partners or having other sexually transmitted infections can increase the risk of infection through sex.</li>
            </ul>
    </li>
	<li>Sharing needles, syringes, rinse water, or other equipment (works) used to prepare injection drugs with someone who has HIV. </li>
</ul>


<p>Less commonly, HIV may be spread by </p>
<ul class="bulleted-links">
	<li>Being born to an infected mother. HIV can be passed from mother to child during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. </li>
    <li>Being stuck with an HIV-contaminated needle or other sharp object. This is a risk mainly for health care workers. </li>
    <li>Receiving blood transfusions, blood products, or organ/tissue transplants that are contaminated with HIV. This risk is extremely small because of rigorous testing of the US blood supply and donated organs and tissues. </li>
    <li>Eating food that has been pre-chewed by an HIV-infected person. The contamination occurs when infected blood from a caregiverâs mouth mixes with food while chewing, and is very rare. </li>
    <li>Being bitten by a person with HIV. Each of the very small number of documented cases has involved severe trauma with extensive tissue damage and the presence of blood. There is no risk of transmission if the skin is not broken. </li>
	<li>Oral sexâusing the mouth to stimulate the penis, vagina, or anus (fellatio, cunnilingus, and rimming). Giving fellatio (mouth to penis oral sex) and having the person ejaculate (cum) in your mouth is riskier than other types of oral sex. </li>
    <li>Contact between broken skin, wounds, or mucous membranes and HIV-infected blood or blood-contaminated body fluids. These reports have also been extremely rare. </li>
    <li>Deep, open-mouth kissing if the person with HIV has sores or bleeding gums and blood is exchanged. HIV is not spread through saliva. Transmission through kissing alone is extremely rare.</li>
</ul>

                  </div>
                  <h4>How well does HIV survive outside the body?</h4>

                        <div class="subc">
<p>HIV does not survive long outside the human body (such as on surfaces), and it cannot reproduce. It <strong>is not</strong> spread by </p>   <br/>

                  <h4>Can I get HIV from anal sex? </h4>
                   <div class="inner">
<p>Yes. In fact, having anal sex without using a condom is the riskiest type of sex for getting or spreading HIV. During anal sex, itâs possible for either partnerâthe insertive (<em>top</em>) or the receptive (<em>bottom</em>)âto get HIV. </p>
<p>HIV can be found in the blood, semen (<em>cum</em>), preseminal fluid (<em>pre-cum</em>), or rectal fluid of a person infected with the virus. The <em>bottom</em> is at greater risk of getting HIV because the lining of the rectum is thin and may allow HIV to enter the body during anal sex, but the top is also at risk because HIV can enter through the opening of the penis or through small cuts, abrasions, or open sores on the penis. See the HIV Prevention Questions and Answers for more information.</p>
</div>
                  
                  
<h4>Can I get HIV from vaginal sex?</h4>
<div class="inner">
<p>Yes, vaginal sex without a condom is a high-risk behavior for HIV infection. It is possible for either partner to become infected this way. HIV can be found in the blood, semen (cum), pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), or vaginal fluid of a person infected with the virus.</p>
<p>During vaginal sex, HIV is passed from men to women much more easily than from women to men. In women, HIV can be directly absorbed through the mucous membranes that line the vagina and cervix.  The lining of the vagina can also sometimes tear and possibly allow HIV to enter the body.</p>
<p>In men, HIV can enter the body through the urethra (the opening at the tip of the penis) or through small cuts or open sores on the penis. Men who are not circumcised are at greater risk of HIV infection through vaginal sex than are circumcised men.</p>
<p>Risk for HIV infection increases if you or a partner also has a sexually transmitted infection (STI). See also Is there a connection between HIV and other sexually transmitted infections?</p>

<p>Many barrier methods that women use to prevent pregnancy (e.g., diaphragm, cervical cap) do not protect them against HIV or other STIs because they still allow infected semen (cum) to come in contact with the lining of the vagina.</p>

<p>Oral or hormonal contraceptives (e.g., birth control pills) do not protect women against HIV or other STIs.</p>
</div>


<h4>Can I get HIV from oral sex or oral-anal contact (rimming)? </h4>
<div class="inner">
<ul class="bulleted-links">
	<li>Oral sex involves using the mouth to stimulate the penis, vagina or anus (i.e.,fellatio, cunnilingus, and rimming). It is possible for either partner to become infected with HIV through performing or receiving oral sex, though the risk is much less than for anal and vaginal sex.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The highest-risk oral sex activity is giving oral sex to a man, if he ejaculates (<em>cums</em>) in your mouth. There is little to no risk of getting HIV from other types of oral sex. Several factors may increase the risk of HIV transmission through oral sexual contact, including mouth ulcers, bleeding gums, genital sores, and the presence of other sexually transmitted infections. </p>

<p>Although rimming carries little to no risk of transmitting HIV, it does come with a high risk of transmitting hepatitis A and B, parasites, and other bacteria to the partner who is doing the rimming.</p>

<p>For more information, see <a href="/hiv/risk/behavior/oralsex.html">Oral Sex and HIV Risk</a>.</p>
</div>




<h4>Is there a connection between HIV and other sexually transmitted infections?</h4>
<div class="inner">
<p>Yes. Having a sexually transmitted infection (STI) can increase the risk of getting or spreading HIV. If you are HIV-negative but have an STI, you are at least 2 to 5 times as likely to get HIV if you have unprotected sex with someone who has HIV. There are two ways that having an STI can increase the likelihood of getting HIV. If the STI causes irritation of the skin (e.g., from syphilis, herpes, or human papillomavirus), breaks or sores may make it easier for HIV to enter the body during sexual contact. Even STIs that cause no breaks or open sores (e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis) can increase your risk by causing inflammation that increases the number of cells that can serve as targets for HIV.</p>

<p>If you are HIV-positive and also infected with another STI, you are 3 to 5 times as likely as other HIV-infected people to spread HIV through sexual contact.  This appears to happen because there is an increased concentration of HIV in the semen and genital fluids of HIV-positive people who also are infected with another STI. </p>

<p>For more information about the connection between HIV and other STIs, see the CDC fact sheet, <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/hiv/STDFact-STD-HIV.htm">The Role of STD Detection and Treatment in HIV Prevention.</a> To get tested for HIV or other STIs, <a href="http://hivtest.cdc.gov/Default.aspx">find a testing site</a> near you. </p>
</div>



<h4>Can I get HIV from injecting drugs? </h4>
<div class="inner">
<p>Yes. At the start of every injection, blood gets into the needle and syringe, and some remains there after use. HIV can be found in the blood of a person infected with the virus. The reuse of an HIV-contaminated needle or syringe by another drug injector (sometimes called direct syringe sharing) carries a high risk of HIV transmission because infected blood can be injected directly into the bloodstream.</p>

<p>Sharing drug equipment (<em>or works</em>) can also be a risk for spreading HIV. Infected blood can get into drug solutions by</p>
<ul class="bulleted-links">
	<li>Using blood-contaminated syringes to prepare drugs. </li>
	<li>Reusing water. </li>
    <li>Reusing bottle caps, spoons, or other containers (<em>cookers</em>) to dissolve drugs in water and to heat drug solutions. </li>
    <li>Reusing small pieces of cotton or cigarette filters (<em>cottons</em>) to filter out particles that could block the needle. </li>
</ul>

<p>âStreet sellersâ of syringes may repackage used syringes and sell them as sterile syringes. For this reason, people who continue to inject drugs should get syringes from reliable sources of sterile syringes, such as pharmacies or needle-exchange programs.</p>

<p>It is important to know that sharing a needle or syringe for any use, including skin popping and injecting steroids, hormones, or silicone, can put you at risk for HIV and other blood-borne infections.</p>

<p>For more information, see If I use drugs, how can I prevent getting HIV?</p>

</div>


<h4>Can I get HIV from using other kinds of drugs?</h4>
<div class="inner">
<p>Not directly, but drinking alcohol or taking drugs that arenât injected can increase your risk for HIV. Being drunk or high affects your ability to make safe choices and lowers your inhibitions, which may lead you to take risks you are less likely to take when sober, such as having sex without a condom. </p>

<p>Methamphetamine (<em>meth</em>) is a very addictive stimulant that can be snorted, smoked, or injected. Even though using meth is an HIV risk factor for anyone who does it, <strong>there is a strong link between meth use and HIV transmission for men who have sex with men</strong> (MSM). MSM who use meth may increase their sexual <strong>and</strong> drug-use risk factors. They may</p>

<ul class="bulleted-links">
    <li>Use condoms less often.</li>
    <li>Have more sex partners and have sex over a longer period of time.</li>
    <li>Engage in unprotected anal sexâespecially as the receptive partner.</li>
    <li>Inject meth instead of smoking or snorting it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Drinking alcohol, particularly binge drinking, and using âclub drugsâ like Ecstasy, ketamine, GHB, and poppers can alter your judgment and impair your decisions about sex or other drug use. You may be more likely to have unplanned and unprotected sex or use other drugs, including injection drugs or meth. Those behaviors can increase your risk of exposure to HIV. If you have HIV, this can also increase your risk of spreading HIV to others.Treatment programs can help people stop using drugs or alcohol. <a href="http://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/">Find a treatment facility near you</a> or call 1-800-662-HELP (1-800-662-4357).</p>

</div>


<h4>If I already have HIV, can I get another kind of HIV?</h4>
<div class="inner">
<p>Yes. This is called HIV superinfection. The new strain of HIV can replace the original strain or remain along with the original strain. The effects of superinfection differ from person to person. For some people, superinfection may cause them to get sicker faster because they become infected with a new strain of the virus that is resistant to the medicines they are currently taking to treat their original HIV infection. Research suggests that the kind of superinfection where a person becomes infected with a new strain of HIV that is hard to treat is rare, less than 4%. </p>
</div>

<h4>Are health care workers at risk of getting HIV on the job? </h4>
<div class="inner">
<p>The risk of health care workers being exposed to HIV on the job (occupational exposure) is very low, especially if they use protective practices and personal protective equipment to prevent HIV and other blood-borne infections. For health care workers on the job, the main risk of HIV transmission is through accidental injuries from needles and other sharp instruments that may be contaminated with the virus; however, even this risk is small. Scientists estimate that the risk of HIV infection from being stuck with a needle used on an HIV-infected person is less than 1%.</p>

<p>For more information on preventing occupational exposure to HIV, see the CDC fact sheet, <a href="/hiv/risk/other/occupational.html">Occupational HIV Transmission and Prevention Among Health Care Workers</a>. </p>
</div>


<h4>Can I get HIV from receiving medical care? </h4>
<div class="inner">
<p>Although HIV transmission is possible in health care settings, it is extremely rare. Careful practice of infection control, including universal precautions (i.e., using protective practices and personal protective equipment to prevent HIV and other blood-borne infections) protects patients as well as health care providers from possible HIV transmission in medical and dental offices and hospitals.</p>

<p>The risk of getting HIV from receiving blood transfusions, blood products, or organ/tissue transplants that are contaminated with HIV is extremely small because of rigorous testing of the US blood supply and donated organs and tissues. </p>

<p>It is important to know that <strong>you cannot get HIV from donating blood</strong>. Blood collection procedures are highly regulated and safe.</p>

<p>For more information on preventing occupational exposure to HIV, see the CDC fact sheet, <a href="/hiv/risk/other/occupational.html">Occupational HIV Transmission and Prevention Among Health Care Workers</a>. For more information on blood and tissue donations, see <a href="http://aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/prevention/reduce-your-risk/blood-transfusions-organ-donation/index.html">AIDS.govâs Blood Transfusions and Organ Donation</a>.</p>
</div>


<h4>Can I get HIV from casual contact (âsocial kissing,â shaking hands, hugging, using a toilet, drinking from the same glass, or the sneezing and coughing of an infected person)? </h4>
<div class="inner">
<p>No. HIV is not spread by day-to-day contact in the workplace, schools, or social settings. HIV is not spread through shaking hands, hugging, or a casual kiss. You cannot become infected from a toilet seat, a drinking fountain, a door knob, dishes, drinking glasses, food, cigarettes, pets, or insects.</p>

<p>HIV is not spread through the air, and it does not live long outside the body.</p>

</div>


<h4>Can I get HIV from a tattoo or a body piercing?</h4>
<div class="inner">
<p>Tattooing or body piercing present a potential risk of HIV transmission, but no cases of HIV transmission from these activities have been documented. Be sure that only new needles, ink, and other supplies are used and that the person doing the procedure is properly licensed.</p>
</div>


<h4>Can I get HIV from being spit on or scratched by an HIV-infected person? </h4>
<div class="inner">
<p>No. HIV cannot be spread through saliva, and there is no documented case of transmission from an HIV-infected person spitting on another person. There is no risk of transmission from scratching because there is no transfer of body fluids between people. </p>
</div>


<h4>Can I get HIV from mosquitoes? </h4>
<div class="inner">
<p>No. There is no evidence of HIV transmission from mosquitoes or any other insectsâeven in areas where there are many cases of HIV and large populations of mosquitoes. Unlike organisms that are transmitted by insect bites, HIV does not reproduce (and does not survive) in insects. </p>
</div>


<h4>Can I get HIV from food? </h4>
<div class="inner">
<p>Except for rare cases in which children consumed food that was pre-chewed by an HIV-infected caregiver, HIV has not been spread through food. The virus does not live long outside the body. You cannot get it from consuming food handled by an HIV-infected person; even if the food contained small amounts of HIV-infected blood or semen, exposure to the air, heat from cooking, and stomach acid would destroy the virus. </p>
</div>


<h4>Are lesbians or other women who have sex with women at risk for HIV? </h4>
<div class="inner">
<p>Case reports of female-to-female transmission of HIV are rare. The well-documented risk of female-to-male transmission shows that vaginal fluids and menstrual blood may contain the virus and that exposure to these fluids through mucous membranes (in the vagina or mouth) could, potentially, lead to HIV infection.</p>
</div>



<h4>Is the risk of HIV different for different people?</h4>
<div class="inner">
<p>Although HIV risk factors and routes of transmission apply to everyone equally, some people are at higher risk because of where they live and who their sex partners are. </p>

<p>The percentage of people living with HIV (<em>prevalence</em>) is higher in major metropolitan areas, so people who live there are more likely to encounter an HIV-positive person among their possible sex partners. (This <a href="http://gis.cdc.gov/GRASP/NCHHSTPAtlas/main.html?s_cid=nchhstp-atlas-005">atlas</a> shows the prevalence of HIV for all US communities.) In the same way, because the prevalence of HIV is higher among gay and bisexual men and among black and Latino men and women, members of these groups are more likely to encounter partners who are living with HIV. </p>
