However, some <em>E. coli</em> are pathogenic, meaning they can cause illness, either diarrhea or illness outside of the intestinal tract. The types of <em>E. coli</em> that can cause diarrhea can be transmitted through contaminated water or food, or through contact with animals or people. These are often called <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/general/index.html">pathotypes</a>.</p><p><em>E. coli</em> can cause diarrhea, urinary tract infections, respiratory illness, bloodstream infections, and other illnesses. Other kinds of <em>E. coli</em> are used as markers for water contaminationâso you might hear about <em>E. coli</em> being found in drinking water, which are not harmful, but indicate the water is contaminated. It does get a bit confusingâeven to microbiologists.</p><h3>What are Shiga toxin-producing <em>E. coli</em>?</h3><!--  START SIDE BOX --><div class="c33r" style=" width: 275px;"><div class="subc"><div class="module rounders bullet-list"><div class="inner"><div class="t"></div><p><strong>Quick Guide to Understanding <em>E. coli</em></strong></p><br/><div class="subColumns"><div class="subc"><p>There are <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/general/index.html">6 different pathotypes</a> of <em>E. coli</em> that cause diarrhea.</p><p>Some <em>E. coli</em> cause disease by making a toxin called Shiga toxin.

The bacteria that make these toxins are called "Shiga toxin-producing <em>E. coli</em>", or STEC. You might hear them called verocytotoxic <em>E. coli</em> (VTEC) or enterohemorrhagic <em>E. coli</em> (EHEC); these all refer generally to the same pathotype of bacteria. STEC is then often sub-divided into two categories: <em>E.coli</em> 0157 and non-0157 STECs.</p><ul><li><strong>Most common type of STEC:</strong> The most commonly identified STEC infections in North America are <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 (often shortened to <em>E. coli</em> O157 or even just "O157"). When you hear news reports about outbreaks of "<em>E. coli</em>" infections, they are usually talking about <em>E. coli</em> O157.</li><li><strong>Other groups of STEC:</strong> Other groups of <em>E. coli</em> in the STEC pathotype are sometimes called "<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23560425">non-O157 STECs</a>."</li></ul><h3>Concerns about non-O157 STECs</h3><p>In addition to <em>E. coli</em> O157, many other "<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23560425">non-O157 STECs</a>" also cause disease. Some "<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23560425">non-O157 STECs</a>" cause disease that is often severe, resulting in bloody diarrhea and sometimes <a href="http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1262307">hemolytic uremic syndrome</a> (HUS), which is a type of kidney failure.</p><!--  START SIDE BOX --><div class="c33r"><div class="subc"><div class="module rounders bullet-list"><div class="inner"><div class="t"></div><div class="subColumns"><div class="subc"><p><strong>Did you know?</strong></p><p><img alt="Photo: Scientist working in a lab" height="175" src="/features/ecoliinfection/ecoliinfection_f175px.jpg" width="175"/>New and faster diagnostic technology called <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/next-generation.html#culture" target="_blank"><strong>culture independent diagnostic testing (CIDT</strong></a>) aids in diagnosing non- 0157 STEC infections.</p><p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23560425">Learn more &gt;&gt;</a></p></div></div></div><div class="b"><div></div></div></div></div></div><ul><li>Public health surveillance data on the occurrence of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23560425">non-O157 STECs</a> is improving; many non-O157 STEC infections go undiagnosed or unreported.</li><li>Identifying <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23560425">non-O157 STEC</a> infections is more complex than identifying those from STEC O157. <ul><li>First, clinical laboratories must test stool samples for the presence of Shiga toxins (the number of laboratories performing these tests has increased greatly).</li><li>Then, the positive samples must be sent to public health laboratories to look for non-O157 STEC.</li></ul></li><li>The most common non-O157 STEC serogroups that cause illness in people in the United States are O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, and O145.</li></ul><h3>About the Illness</h3><ul><li>People usually get sick from STEC within 2 to 8 days after swallowing the organism. <ul><li>Most people develop diarrhea (often bloody) and abdominal cramps.</li><li>Most illnesses resolve on their own within 7 days.
