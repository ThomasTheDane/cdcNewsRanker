<h1>Basic Information About Prostate Cancer</h1>

<p><em>Cancer</em> is a disease in which cells in the body grow out of control. When cancer starts in the prostate, it is called <em>prostate cancer</em>.</p>

<p>Many men with prostate cancer—especially those with tumors that have not spread beyond the prostate—die of <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/cancerresearchnews/2012/MenWithProstateCancerCausesOfDeath">other causes</a> without ever having any symptoms from the cancer.</p>

<p>Except for skin cancer, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in American men. It is the second most common cause of death from cancer among white, African American, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Hispanic men, and the fourth most common cause of death from cancer among Asian/Pacific Islander men.</p>
