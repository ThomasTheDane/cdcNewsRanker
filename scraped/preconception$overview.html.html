It focuses on taking steps now to protect the health of a baby they might have sometime in the future.</p><p>However, all women and men can benefit from preconception health, whether or not they plan to have a baby one day. This is because part of preconception health is about people getting and staying healthy overall, throughout their lives. In addition, no one expects an unplanned pregnancy. But it happens often. In fact, about half of all pregnancies in the United States are not planned.</p><p><!-- --></p><div class="rx-row">

For babies, preconception health means their parents took steps to get healthy before pregnancy. Such babies are less likely to be born early (preterm) or have a low birthweight. They are more likely to be born without birth defects or other disabling conditions.<sup><a href="/preconception/overview.html#ref">1</a></sup> Preconception health gives babies the best gift of allâthe best chance for a healthy start in life.</p><p><a href="/pregnancy/after.html">Learn more about how to help keep you and your baby healthy and safe Â»</a></p><p><!-- --></p><h3>Healthy Families</h3><p><!-- --></p><p>Ensuring preconception health is a great way to create a healthy family.
