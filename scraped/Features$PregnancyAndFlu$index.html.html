Changes in the immune system, heart and lungs during pregnancy make pregnant women more prone to severe illness from flu, which can lead to hospitalization or even death. A pregnant woman with the flu also has a greater chance of serious problems for her unborn baby, including premature labor and delivery.</p><p><b>A flu shot can protect pregnant women, their unborn babies, and even the baby after birth.</b></p><p>Watch a <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/CDCTV/ProtectBaby">short, fun video</a> that explains why!</p><h3>The Flu Shot is the Best Protection against Flu</h3><p>Getting a flu shot is the first and most important step in protecting against flu. When given during pregnancy, the flu shot has been shown to protect both the mother and her baby (up to 6 months old) from flu. The flu shot is safe to get at any time while you are pregnant, during any trimester. (The nasal spray vaccine should not be given to women who are pregnant.) An additional way to protect the baby is for all of the baby's caregivers and close contacts (including parents, brothers and sisters, grandparents and babysitters) to get vaccinated against the flu. Learn more about the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/keyfacts.htm">flu vaccine</a>.</p><h3>The Flu Shot is Safe for Pregnant Women</h3><p>Flu shots are a safe way to protect pregnant women and their unborn children from serious illness and complications of flu, like pneumonia. The flu shot has been given to millions of pregnant women over many years. Flu shots have not been shown to cause harm to pregnant women or their babies. It is very important for pregnant women to get the flu shot.</p><h3>Other Preventive Actions</h3><p>In addition to getting the flu shot, pregnant women should take additional <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/habits">everyday preventive actions</a>.</p><h3>Early Treatment is Important for Pregnant Women</h3><div class="righty" style=" width: 225px;"><div class="module rounders">
