<h3><a id="what-is" name="what-is"></a>What Is Cancer?</h3>
 
<p>Cancer refers to diseases in which abnormal cells divide out of control and are able to invade other tissues. Cancer cells can spread to other parts of the body through the blood and lymph systems.<sup><a href="#one">1,</a><a href="#two">2</a></sup> </p>
 
<p>There are more than 100 different types of cancer. Most cancers are named for the organ or type of cell in which they start—for example, lung cancer begins in the lung and laryngeal cancer begins in the larynx (voice box).<sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Symptoms can include:<sup><a href="#three">3</a></sup></p>
<ul>
  <li>A thickening or lump in any part of the  body </li>
  <li>Weight loss or gain with no known  reason</li>
  <li>Sores that won't heal</li>
  <li>A new mole or a changes in an  existing mole</li>
  <li>Hoarseness or a cough that does not go  away</li>
  <li>A hard time swallowing</li>
  <li>Indigestion or pain after eating that  does not go away</li>
  <li>Changes in bowel or bladder habits</li>
  <li>Unusual bleeding or discharge</li>
  <li>Feeling weak or very tired</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="how_related" name="how_related"></a>How Is Smoking Related to Cancer?</h3>
 
<p>Smoking can cause cancer and then block your body from fighting it:<sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup></p>
 
<ul>
  <li>Poisons in cigarette smoke can weaken the body’s  immune system, making it harder to kill cancer cells. When this happens, cancer  cells keep growing without being stopped. </li>
  <li>Poisons in tobacco smoke can damage or change a  cell's DNA. DNA is the cell's "instruction manual" that controls a cell's  normal growth and function. When DNA is damaged, a cell can begin growing out  of control and create a cancer tumor. </li>
</ul>
<p>Doctors have known for years that smoking causes most lung cancer. Nearly 9 out of 10 men who die from lung cancer are smokers. And about 3,000 nonsmokers die each year from lung cancer caused by secondhand smoke.<sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup></p>
 <p>Smoking can cause cancer almost anywhere in your body, including the:<sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup></p>
 <ul>
   <li>Mouth, nose, and throat</li>
   <li>Larynx</li>
   <li>Trachea</li>
   <li>Esophagus</li>
   <li>Lungs</li>
   <li>Stomach</li>
   <li>Pancreas</li>
   <li>Kidneys and ureters</li>
   <li>Bladder</li>
   <li>Cervix</li>
   <li>Bone marrow and blood </li>
 </ul>
 <p>Smokeless tobacco also causes cancer, including cancers of the:<sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup></p>
 <ul>
   <li>Esophagus</li>
   <li>Mouth and throat</li>
   <li>Pancreas</li>
 </ul>

<h3><a id="how_prevented" name="how_prevented"></a>How Can Smoking-Related Cancers Be Prevented?</h3>
<p>Quitting smoking lowers the risks for cancers of the lung, mouth,  throat, esophagus, and larynx.<sup><a href="#four">4,</a><a href="#six">6</a></sup></p>
<ul>
  <li>Within 5 years of quitting, your chance of  cancer of the mouth, throat, esophagus, and bladder is cut in half.<sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup></li>
  <li>Ten years after you quit smoking, your risk of dying  from lung cancer drops by half.<sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>If nobody smoked, one of every three cancer deaths in the United States  would not happen.<sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup></p>

<h3><a id="how_treated" name="how_treated"></a>How Is Cancer Treated?</h3>
<p>The treatment for cancer depends on the type of cancer and the stage of  the disease (how severe the cancer is and whether it has spread). Doctors may  also consider the patient's age and general health. Often, the goal of  treatment is to cure the cancer. In other cases, the goal is to control the  disease or to reduce symptoms for as long as possible. The treatment plan for a  person may change over time.<sup><a href="#seven">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Most treatment plans include surgery, radiation therapy, or  chemotherapy. Some plans involve hormone therapy (a  treatment to keep cancer cells  from getting the hormones they need to grow). Other  plans involve biological therapy (a treatment that helps your immune  system fight cancer). </p>
<p>Some cancers respond best to a single type of treatment. Other cancers may  respond best to a combination of treatments.<sup><a href="#seven">7</a></sup></p>
<p>For patients who get very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation  therapy, a stem cell transplant, also known as a bone marrow transplant, may be  recommended by their doctor. This  is because high-dose therapies destroy both cancer cells and normal  blood cells. A stem cell  transplant can help the body to make healthy blood cells to replace the ones  lost due to the cancer treatment. It’s a complicated procedure with many side  effects and risks.<sup><a href="#eight">8</a></sup></p>
