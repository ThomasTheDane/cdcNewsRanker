<h1>Radiation and Potassium Iodide (KI)</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
 <p> This fact sheet from the Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC) gives you some basic information about Radiation and  Potassium Iodide (KI). It explains what you should think about before you or a  family member takes KI.</p>

            <h2>Key Facts</h2>
      <ul class="bulleted-links">
        <li>At this  time, CDC does not recommend that people in the United States take KI or iodine  supplements in response to the nuclear power plant explosions in Japan.</li>
        <li>You should only take KI on the advice of emergency management officials,  public health officials, or your doctor. </li>
        <li>There are <a href="http://emergency.cdc.gov/radiation/ki.asp#med">health risks</a> associated with taking KI. </li>

<h2>What Is Radiation?</h2>
 <p> Radiation is a form of energy that is present all around us.  Different types of radiation exist, some of which have more energy than others. </p>
 <h2>What Is Radioactive Contamination? </h2>
  <p> Radioactive contamination occurs when radioactive material  is deposited on or in an object or a person. Radioactive materials released  into the environment can cause air, water, surfaces, soil, plants, buildings,  people, or animals to become contaminated. A contaminated person has  radioactive materials on or inside their body.</p>
 <h2>What  is KI? </h2>
  <p> Potassium iodide (also called KI)  is a salt of stable (not radioactive) iodine. Stable iodine is an important  chemical needed by the body to make thyroid hormones. Most of the stable iodine  in our bodies comes from the food we eat. KI is stable iodine in a medicine  form. </p>
<h2>What  does KI do? </h2> <p>
   If radioactive iodine is released into the  air after a radiological or nuclear event it can be breathed into the lungs. In  most cases, once radioactive iodine has entered the body, the thyroid gland  quickly absorbs it. After it has been absorbed into the thyroid gland,  radioactive iodine can then cause thyroid gland injury. Because KI acts to  block radioactive iodine from being taken into the thyroid gland, it can help  protect this gland from injury. </p>
 <p>It is also important to know what KI cannot  do. <em>KI cannot </em>protect parts of the body other than the thyroid from  radioactive iodine. <em>KI cannot </em>protect the body from any radioactive  elements other than iodine. If radioactive iodine is not present, then taking  KI is not protective.</p>
<h2>How  does KI work? </h2> <p>
   The thyroid gland cannot tell the difference  between stable and radioactive iodine and will absorb both. KI works by  blocking radioactive iodine from entering the thyroid. When a person takes KI,  the stable iodine in the medicine gets absorbed by the thyroid. There is so  much stable iodine in the KI that the thyroid gland becomes âfullâ and cannot  absorb any more iodineâeither stable or radioactiveâfor the next 24 hours. </p>
<h2>How  well does KI work? </h2> <p>
   It is  important to know that KI may not give a person 100% protection against  radioactive iodine. How well KI blocks radioactive iodine depends on: </p>
 <ul>
   <li>How much  time passes between contamination with radioactive iodine and taking KI (the  sooner a person takes KI after being exposed to radioactive iodine, the  better), </li>

   <li>How fast KI  is absorbed into the blood, and </li>

   <li>The total  amount of radioactive iodine to which a person is exposed. </li>
 </ul>
 <p> </p>
 <p>A single  dose of KI protects the thyroid gland for 24 hours. <strong>Taking a higher dose of  KI, or taking KI more often than recommended, does not offer more protection  and can cause severe illness or death.</strong></p>
<h2>Medical  conditions that may make it harmful to take KI </h2> <p>
   It may be  harmful for some people to take KI because of the high levels of iodine in this  medicine. You should not take KI if:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>You know you  are allergic to iodine (If you are unsure about this, consult your doctor. A  seafood or shellfish allergy does not necessarily mean that you are allergic to  iodine.) OR </li>

   <li>You have  certain skin disorders (such as dermatitis herpetiformis or urticaria  vasculitis). </li>
 </ul>
<h2>When  should I take KI? </h2> <p>
   After a  radiological or nuclear event in the United States, local public health or  emergency management officials will tell the public if there is a need to take  KI or other protective actions. <strong>After an  event in the US, you should follow the instructions given to you by these local  authorities.</strong>
</p><p><strong>At this time, CDC does not  recommend that people in the United States take Potassium Iodide (KI) or iodine  supplements in response to the nuclear power plant explosions in Japan.</strong></p>
 <p>The use of  non-FDA approved iodine supplements cannot be guaranteed for safety or  efficacy. These products do not have an FDA-approved dosing schedule. The  supplements are not necessarily manufactured using FDA-approved quality control  methods. Saturated Solution of Potassium Iodide (SSKI or Lugolâs Solution) is  not an FDA-approved drug.</p>
 <p>Scientists  are tracking the location of radioactive iodine released from the power plant  in Japan. The EPA monitors  for radioactivity through a national network of monitoring stations called  RADNET.</p>
