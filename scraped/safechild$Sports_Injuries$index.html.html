            We all want to keep our children safe and secure and help them live to their
            full potential. Knowing how to prevent injuries from sports and recreation
            activities, one of the leading causes of child injury, is a step toward this goal.</p>
          <p>Taking part in sports and recreation activities is an important part of a healthy, physically active
            lifestyle for kids. But injuries can, and do, occur. More  than 2.6 million children 0-19 years old are treated in the emergency  department each year for sports and recreation-related injuries. Â </p>
          <p>Thankfully, there are steps that parents can take to help make sure kids stay safe on the field, the
            court, or wherever they play or participate in sports and recreation activities.</p>
          <h2><a id="tips" name="tips"></a>Prevention Tips</h2>
          <p align="left"><strong>Gear  up.</strong> When children are active in sports and recreation, make sure they use the right  protective gear for their activity, such as helmets, wrist guards, knee or  elbow pads.</p>
          <p align="left"> <strong>Use  the right stuff.</strong> Be sure that sports protective equipment is  in good  condition and worn correctly all the timeâfor example, avoid missing or broken  buckles or compressed or worn padding. Poorly fitting equipment may be  uncomfortable and may not offer the best protection.</p>
          <p align="left"> <strong>Practice  makes perfect.</strong> Have children learn and practice skills they need in their  activity. For example, knowing how to tackle safely is important in preventing  injuries in football and soccer. Have children practice proper form â this can  prevent injuries during baseball, softball, and many other activities. Also, be  sure to safely and slowly increase activities to improve physical fitness;  being in good condition can protect kids from injury.</p>
          <p align="left"> <strong>Pay  attention to temperature.</strong> Allow time for child athletes to gradually  adjust to hot or humid environments to prevent heat-related injuries or  illness. Parents and coaches should pay close attention to make sure that  players are hydrated and appropriately dressed.</p>
          <p align="left"> <strong>Be a good model.</strong> Communicate  positive safety messages and serve as a model of safe behavior, including wearing  a helmet and following the rules.</p>
