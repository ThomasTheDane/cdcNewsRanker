				<h1><span class="disease">Cryptosporidium</span> ("Crypto")</h1>
						   
                        <p><em>Cryptosporidium</em> is  one of the leading causes of waterborne disease, or disease caused by  contaminated drinking water or recreational water. Recreational water is water  from swimming pools, hot tubs, fountains, lakes, rivers, springs, ponds, or  streams that can be contaminated with sewage or feces from humans or animals. Below  are answers to the most common questions regarding <em>Cryptosporidium</em> and  healthy swimming.</p>

                        <h2><a name="what"></a>What is Crypto?</h2>

                        <p>Crypto (krip-TOE), short for <span class="disease">Cryptosporidium</span>, is a germ that causes diarrhea. This germ is found in the fecal matter of a person who has been infected by Crypto. It has a tough outer shell that allows it to survive for a long time in the environment. It can survive for days even in properly chlorinated pools.</p>

                        <p>The disease caused by infection with the germ Crypto is called cryptosporidiosis. Crypto is microscopic, so it canât be seen with the naked eye.</p>

                        <br/>		    
                        <p>Crypto is one of the leading causes of recreational  water illness (disease caused by germs spread through water in the places we  swim) in the United States and can cause prolonged diarrhea (for 2â3 weeks).</p>
<p>It can make anyone sick, but certain groups of people are more likely to become seriously ill when infected with Crypto:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Young children</li>
                        <li>Pregnant women</li>
                        <li>Individuals with weakened immune systems</li>
                        </ul>
						<br/>
                        <p>During the past two decades, Crypto has become recognized as one of the leading causes of waterborne illness in the United States. The germ is found in every part of the United States and the world.</p>

                        <br/>
                        <p>Crypto is not spread by contact with blood. Crypto can be spread by:</p>
                          <ul>
                          <li>Swallowing recreational water contaminated with Crypto. You share the waterâand the germs in itâwith every person who enters the pool. This means that just one person with diarrhea can easily contaminate the water. Swallowing even a small amount of pool water that has been contaminated with the Crypto germ can make you sick. </li>
                          <li>Putting something in your mouth or swallowing something (such as food) that has come in contact with the feces of a person or animal infected with Crypto.</li>
                          <li>Swallowing Crypto picked up from surfaces (such as lounge chairs, picnic tables, bathroom fixtures, changing tables) contaminated with feces from an infected person.</li>
                          </ul>

                        <br/>
                        <p>Take action! Crypto can stay alive for days even in  well-maintained pools. We all share the water we swim in, so each of us plays  an essential role in helping to protect ourselves, our families, and our  friends from Crypto and other germs. </p>
                        <p><strong>All swimmers</strong> should take the following easy and effective  healthy swimming steps: </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>Keep the poop, germs, and pee out of the water.</strong>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Don't swim when you have diarrhea.</li>
                              <li>Shower with soap before you start swimming.
                                <ul>
                                  <li>Take a rinse shower before you get back into the water.</li>
                                </ul>
                              </li>
                              <li>Take bathroom breaks every 60 minutes. The mixing of chlorine with pee and sweat uses up the chlorine in the pool, which would otherwise quickly kill most germs.</li>
                              <li>Wash your hands after using the toilet or changing diapers.</li>
                            </ul>
                          </li>
                          <li><strong>Check the free chlorine level and pH before getting into the water.</strong>
                            <ul>
                              
                              <li>Pools: Proper free chlorine level (1–3 mg/L or parts per million  [ppm]) and pH (7.2–7.8) maximize germ-killing power. </li>
                              <li>Hot tubs/spas: Proper disinfectant level (chlorine [2â4 parts per million or ppm] or bromine [4â6 ppm] and pH [7.2â7.8]) maximize germ-killing power.</li>
                              <li>Most superstores, hardware stores, and pool-supply stores  sell pool test strips.</li>
                            </ul>
                          </li>
                          <li><strong>Don't swallow the water you swim in.</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                <br/>
                        <p>Parents of young children should take a few extra steps:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>Take children on bathroom breaks every 60 minutes or check diapers every 30–60 minutes.</strong>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Change diapers in the bathroom or diaper-changing area and not at poolside where germs can rinse into the water.</li>
                            </ul>
                          </li>
                        </ul>
