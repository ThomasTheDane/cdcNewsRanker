As long as flu viruses are still circulating, you can still benefit from a flu vaccine. Flu vaccination is the first and most important thing you can do to protect against flu. Get yours today!</p></div><!-- END BANNER SECTION --><div class="subColumns"><h3>Don't let the flu catch <em>you</em> by surprise this season. Be prepared; get vaccinated today.</h3><p>After a busy holiday season, you might be reluctant to add one more thing to your to-do list. But it's worth it.</p><p>"Getting the flu vaccine is simple, and it's the most important thing you can do to protect yourself and your family from the flu," says Dr. Anne Schuchat, Assistant Surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service and Director of CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.</p><p>Flu season is here! Flu activity is widespread in most of the country, with high levels of flu activity likely to continue for several weeks. If you have not gotten your flu vaccination yet this season, you should get one now. A <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/keyfacts.htm">flu vaccine</a> is the first and best way to protect yourself and the people around you from influenza and its potentially serious complications.</p><h3>Get a Flu Vaccine Every Flu Season</h3><p><strong>The best way to protect against the flu is to get a flu vaccine every flu season.</strong> The flu is a <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/spread.htm">contagious</a> respiratory disease that can lead to serious complications, hospitalization, or even death. Anyone can get the flu, and <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine">getting a flu vaccine</a> is the single best way to protect yourself and your family. Even healthy people can get very sick from the flu and spread it to friends and loved ones. Everyone 6 months of age and older is recommended to get vaccinated against the flu every year.</p><p>Flu activity is unpredictable but often peaks in February. And although there are many different flu viruses, the yearly flu vaccine protects against the viruses that research suggests will be most common that flu season.</p><p>Important reminder for <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/children.htm">parents and caregivers</a>: Many children getting vaccinated against the flu for the first time will need <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/children.htm#special">2 doses of flu vaccine to be fully protected</a>. If a child has not received his/her first dose, get them vaccinated now. For those who have been vaccinated with one dose, parents should check with the child's doctor to see if a second dose is needed for the best possible protection.</p><h3>Who Is at Risk?</h3><p><strong>Everyone is at risk for getting the flu.</strong> For millions of people each year, the flu can bring a fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle aches, fatigue, and miserable days spent in bed. However, you may not realize that the flu also leads to more than 200,000 flu-related hospitalizations per year. The flu also can be deadly. Between 1976 and 2007, CDC estimates that annual flu-associated deaths in the United States ranged from a low of about 3,000 people to a high of about 49,000 people.</p><p><img alt="Photo: Pregnant woman and son sitting on floor" class="stroke righty" height="203" src="/features/fluprevention/fluprevention_a200px.jpg" width="200"/>Anyone can get the flu, but some people are at <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/high_risk.htm">greater risk</a> for serious flu-related complications, like pneumonia. For those at greater risk for complications, getting the flu vaccine is especially important. Some of the groups at greater risk include:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/children.htm#children">Children younger than 5 years old, but especially children younger than 2 years old</a></li><li><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/pregnant.htm">Pregnant women</a></li><li>People with certain medical conditions like <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/asthma">asthma</a>, <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/diabetes/index.htm">diabetes</a>, or <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/heartdisease/index.htm">heart</a> and lung disease</li><li><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/65over.htm">People 65 years and older</a></li></ul><p>It also is important to get vaccinated if you care for anyone in these high risk groups, including babies younger than 6 months because they are too young to get vaccinated themselves.</p><h3>Get Vaccinated â It's Not Too Late</h3><p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/freeresources/"><img alt="Poster: No More Excuse.
