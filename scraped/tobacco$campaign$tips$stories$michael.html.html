<p>"I was suffocating to death!" That's how Michael—a veteran, an Alaska Native, and member of the Tlingit tribe—thinks back to why he quit smoking. A smoker since he was 9, Michael was addicted to cigarettes for most of his adult life, including the 2 years he served in the U.S. Army. At 44, he was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD—a condition also referred to as chronic bronchitis or emphysema—that makes it harder and harder to breathe. He ignored the symptoms until age 52, when he awoke gasping for air. He quit smoking that day.  </p>
<p>Since then, Michael has had to have part of his lungs removed to improve his condition. However, COPD does not go away, and Michael now needs a lung transplant. He desperately wants to be around for his grandchildren, but he feels heâs running out of time.

          <p><strong>Michael</strong> suffers from COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), which makes it harder for a person to breathe and can cause death. In this video from CDC's <em>Tips From Former Smokers</em> campaign, Michael talks about how he wishes he had never started smoking, and the damage it caused to his lungs. He describes waking up one morning unable to breathe and having to go to the hospital. He also talks about the pain his condition has brought to his family.</p>
