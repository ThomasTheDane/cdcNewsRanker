Stinging or biting insects include bees, wasps, hornets, and fire ants. Outdoor workers at risk of exposure to them include farmers, foresters, landscapers, groundskeepers, gardeners, painters, roofers, pavers, construction workers, laborers, mechanics, and any other workers who spend time outside.</p><p>The health effects of stinging or biting insects or scorpions range from mild discomfort or pain to a lethal reaction for those workers allergic to the insectâs venom. Anaphylactic shock is the bodyâs severe allergic reaction to a bite or sting and requires immediate emergency care. Thousands of people are stung by insects each year, and as many as 90â100 people in the United States die as a result of allergic reactions. This number may be underreported as deaths may be mistakenly diagnosed as heart attacks or sunstrokes or may be attributed to other causes.</p><p>It is important for employers to train their workers about their risk of exposure to insects and scorpions, how they can prevent and protect themselves from stings and bites, and what they should do if they are stung or bitten.</p><h3><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="bees" name="bees" title="Bees, Wasps, and Hornets"></a>Bees, Wasps, and Hornets</h3><p>Â <img alt="Bees" class="" height="115" src="/niosh/topics/insects/images/bee1.jpg" width="164"/>Â Â Â <img alt="Bees" class="" height="115" src="/niosh/topics/insects/images/bee2.jpg" width="174"/>Â Â Â <img alt="Bees" class="" height="115" src="/niosh/topics/insects/images/bee3.jpg" width="179"/>Â <br/><span class="caption">Photos courtesy of Gary Alpert (1) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (2 &amp; 3)</span></p><p>Bees, wasps, and hornets are most abundant in the warmer months.

(Sweat may anger bees.)</li><li>Wear clothing to cover as much of the body as possible.</li><li>Avoid flowering plants when possible.</li><li>Keep work areas clean. Social wasps thrive in places where humans discard food.</li><li>Remain calm and still if a single stinging insect is flying around. (Swatting at an insect may cause it to sting.)</li><li>If you are attacked by several stinging insects at once, run to get away from them. (Bees release a chemical when they sting, which may attract other bees.) <ul><li>Go indoors.</li><li>A shaded area is better than an open area to get away from the insects.</li><li>If you are able to physically move out of the area, do not to attempt to jump into water. Some insects (particularly Africanized Honey Bees) are known to hover above the water, continuing to sting once you surface for air.</li></ul></li><li>If a bee comes inside your vehicle, stop the car slowly, and open all the windows.</li><li>Workers with a history of severe allergic reactions to insect bites or stings should consider carrying an epinephrine auto injector (EpiPen) and should wear a medical identification bracelet or necklace stating their allergy.</li></ul><h5>First Aid</h5><p>If a worker is stung by a bee, wasp, or hornet:</p><ul><li>Have someone stay with the worker to be sure that they do not have an allergic reaction.</li><li>Wash the site with soap and water.</li><li>Remove the stinger using gauze wiped over the area or by scraping a fingernail over the area. <ul><li>Never squeeze the stinger or use tweezers.</li></ul></li><li>Apply ice to reduce swelling.</li><li>Do not scratch the sting as this may increase swelling, itching, and risk of infection.</li></ul><h4>Additional Resources</h4><p>Â <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/ehs/Docs/Pictorial_Keys/Hymenoptera.pdf">CDC Stinging Hymenoptera: Pictorial Key to Some Common U.S. Families</a>Â Â  [PDF - 1.20 MB]</p><p>Â <a href="http://www.nasdonline.org/docs/d000701-d000800/d000800/d000800.html">National Ag Safety Database: First Aid for Bee and Insect Stings</a></p><p>Â <a href="http://www.ianrpubs.unl.edu/epublic/pages/publicationD.jsp?publicationId=355">University of Nebraska-Lincoln Extension Ã¢â¬â NebGuide: Stinging Wasps and Bees</a></p><p>Â <a href="http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/insect/05525.html">Colorado State University Extension: Nuisance Wasps and Bees</a></p><h3><a id="ants" name="ants"></a>Fire Ants</h3><p>Â <img alt="Ants" class="" height="150" src="/niosh/topics/insects/images/ants1.jpg" width="129"/>Â Â Â <img alt="Ants2" class="" height="150" src="/niosh/topics/insects/images/ants2.jpg" width="204"/>Â Â Â <img alt="Ants3" class="" height="150" src="/niosh/topics/insects/images/ants3.jpg" width="172"/>Â <br/><span class="caption">Photos courtesy of National Center for Environmental Health (1 &amp; 2) and Harold G.

They are aggressive when stinging and inject venom, which causes a burning sensation.
