            <h2>Syphilis -  CDC Fact Sheet</h2>
            <h4>Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that can have very serious complications when left untreated, but it is simple to cure with the right treatment.</h4>

<a id="a1"></a><h3>What is syphilis?</h3>
            <p>Syphilis is an STD  that can cause long-term complications and/or death if not treated correctly. Symptoms in adults are divided into stages. These stages are primary, secondary, latent, and late syphilis.</p>

<a id="a2"></a><h3>How is syphilis spread?</h3>
            <p>You can get syphilis  by direct contact with a syphilis sore during anal, vaginal, or oral sex. Sores can be found on the penis, vagina, anus, in the rectum, or on the lips and in  the mouth. Syphilis can also be spread from <a href="/std/pregnancy/STDFact-Pregnancy.htm">an infected mother to her unborn baby</a>.</p>

<a id="a3"></a><h3>What does syphilis look like?</h3>
            <p>Syphilis has been called âthe great imitatorâ because it has so many possible symptoms, many of which look like symptoms from other diseases. The painless syphilis sore that you would get after you are first infected can be confused for an ingrown hair, zipper cut, or other seemingly harmless bump. The non-itchy body rash that develops during the second stage of syphilis can show up on the palms of your hands and soles of your feet, all over your body, or in just a few places. You could also be infected with syphilis and have very mild symptoms or none at all.</p>

<a id="a4"></a><h3>How can I avoid getting syphilis?</h3>
<p>You can protect yourself  from getting syphilis by:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Not having sex;</li>
              <li>Being in a long-term  mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and has negative STD test results; and</li>
              <li>Using latex condoms and dental dams the right way every time you have sex.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Washing your genitals, urinating, or douching after sex will <em>not</em> protect you from getting syphilis.</p>
<p class="topOPage" style="display:none;"><a class="mobileBackToTop" href="#">Back to Top</a></p>
<a id="a5"></a>
<h3>Am I at risk for syphilis?</h3>
<p>Any sexually active person can get syphilis through unprotected anal, vaginal, or oral sex. Have an honest and open talk with your health care provider and ask whether  you should be tested for syphilis or other STDs. You should get tested  regularly for syphilis if you are pregnant, are a <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/msmhealth/STD.htm">man who has sex with men</a>, have HIV infection, and/or have partner(s) who have tested positive for  syphilis.</p>

<a id="a6"></a>
<h3>Iâm pregnant. How does syphilis affect my baby?</h3>
<p>If you are <a href="/std/pregnancy/STDFact-Pregnancy.htm">pregnant</a> and have syphilis, you can give the infection to your unborn baby. This  can lead to low birth weight, making it more likely for you to deliver your  baby too early, or even being stillborn (a baby born dead). To protect your  baby, <strong>you should be tested for syphilis during your pregnancy and at  delivery and receive immediate treatment if you test positive.</strong></p>
<p>An infected baby may be born without signs or symptoms of disease. However, if not treated  immediately, the baby may develop serious problems within a few weeks. Untreated babies can have health problems such as cataracts, deafness, or  seizures, and can die. </p>

<h3>How do I know if I have syphilis?</h3>
<p>Symptoms of syphilis in adults can be divided into stages:</p>
<h4><em>Primary Stage</em></h4>
<p>During the first (primary) stage of syphilis, you may notice a single sore, but there may be  multiple sores. The sore is the location where syphilis entered your body. The sore is usually firm, round, and painless. Because the sore is painless, it can easily go unnoticed. The sore lasts 3 to 6 weeks and heals regardless of whether or not you receive treatment. Even though the sore goes away, you must still receive treatment so your infection does not move to the secondary stage.</p>

<h4><em>Secondary Stage</em></h4>
<p>During the secondary stage, you may have skin rashes and/or sores in your mouth, vagina, or anus (also called mucous membrane lesions). This stage usually starts with a rash on one or more areas of your body. The rash can show up when your primary sore is healing or several weeks after the sore has healed. The rash can look like rough, red, or reddish brown spots on the palms of your hands and/or the bottoms of your feet. The rash usually won’t itch and it is sometimes so faint that you won’t notice it. Other symptoms you may have can include fever, swollen lymph glands, sore throat, patchy hair loss, headaches, weight loss, muscle aches, and fatigue (feeling very tired). The symptoms from this stage will go away whether or not you receive treatment. Without the right treatment, your infection will move to the latent and possibly late stages of syphilis.</p>

</div>	
<h4><em>Latent and Late Stages</em></h4>
<p>The latent stage of syphilis begins when all of the symptoms you had earlier disappear. If you do not receive treatment, you can continue to have syphilis in your body for years without any signs or symptoms. Most people with untreated syphilis do not develop late stage syphilis. However, when it does happen it is very serious and would occur 10â30 years after your infection began. Symptoms of the late stage of syphilis include difficulty coordinating your muscle movements, paralysis (not able to move certain parts of your body), numbness, blindness, and dementia (mental disorder). In the late stages of syphilis, the disease damages your internal organs and can result in  death.</p>
<p>A syphilis infection is called an <a href="/std/stats10/app-casedef.htm#Syphilis">‘early’ case</a> if a patient has been infected for a year or less, such as during the primary or secondary stages of syphilis. People who have ‘early’ syphilis infections can more easily spread the infection to their sex  partners. The majority of early syphilis cases are currently found among <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/msmhealth/STD-syphilis-graph.htm">men who have sex with men</a>, but women and unborn children are also at risk of  infection.</p>

<a id="a8"></a><h3>How will my doctor know if I have syphilis?</h3>
            <p>Most of the time, a blood test can be used to test for syphilis. Some health care providers will diagnose syphilis by testing fluid from a syphilis sore.</p>

            <p>Yes, syphilis can be cured with the right antibiotics from  your health care provider. However, treatment will not undo any damage that the  infection has already done.</p>
            <p class="topOPage" style="display:none;"><a class="mobileBackToTop" href="#">Back to Top</a></p>
<a id="a10"></a><h3>Iâve been treated. Can I get syphilis again?</h3>
            <p>Having syphilis once does not protect you from getting it again. Even after you’ve been  successfully treated, you can still be re-infected. Only laboratory tests can confirm whether you have syphilis. Follow-up testing by your health care provider is recommended to make sure that your treatment was successful.</p>
            <p>Because syphilis  sores can be hidden in the vagina, anus, under the foreskin of the penis, or in the mouth, it may not be obvious that a sex partner has syphilis. Unless you know that your sex partner(s) has been tested and treated, you may be at risk  of getting syphilis again from an untreated sex partner.</p>
