But women who smoke during pregnancy put themselves and their unborn babies at risk for other health problems. The dangers of smoking during pregnancy include premature birth, certain birth defects, and infant death. Even being around cigarette smoke puts a woman and her baby at risk for health problems.</p><div class="c50l"><h3>The Good News</h3><p>Quitting smoking before getting pregnant is best. But for women who are already pregnant, quitting as early as possible can still help protect against some health problems, such as low birth weight. It is never "too late" to quit smoking.</p><h3>Quit for Good!</h3><p>It is important to quit smoking for good. Some women might think it is safe to start smoking again after their baby is born. But these babies are not out of harm's way. Babies who are around cigarette smoke have weaker lungs than other babies. They are more likely to have other health problems such as infections and more frequent asthma attacks. Being around cigarette smoke is also one of the risk factors of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).</p><p>Though quitting for good can be hard, the benefits are worth itâa healthy baby and many more years of good health to enjoy with him or her.</p></div><div class="c50r"><div class="subcr"><div class="cdc-caption"><img alt="Photo: Chart: Smoking can cause problems for a woman trying to become pregnant or who is already pregnant, and for her baby before and after birth.
