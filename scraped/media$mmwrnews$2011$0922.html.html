<p><em>According to cases  reported through a federally funded pesticide illness surveillance program, 111  cases of acute illness arising from the use of insecticides to control bed bugs  occurred in seven states during 2003-2010. </em>The majority of cases (93  percent) occurred among people living in private residences, and most  frequently involved nervous system, respiratory, and gastrointestinal  effects.Â  Frequently contributing factors  included excessive insecticide application, failure to wash or change  pesticide-treated bedding, and either a lack of notification or ineffective  notification of pesticide application.Â  Although the  number of acute illnesses from insecticides used to control bed bugs does not  suggest a large public health burden, such incidents can have serious health  effects. Recommended preventive measures to protect residents and applicators,  and to keep cases from escalating, include strengthening media campaigns to  educate the public about bed bugârelated issues, including nonchemical methods  to control bed bugs, methods to prevent bed bug infestation (e.g, avoiding the  purchase of used mattresses, box springs, and bedding), prudent use of  effective insecticides, and selection of certified applicators if pesticides  are used.</p>

<h4 id="two">2. Dental Caries in Rural Alaska Native Children, 2008</h4>
<p>CDC Division of News and Electronic Media<br/>
<strong>(404) 639-3286</strong></p>

<p><em>Dental  cavities are prevalent among rural Alaska Native children and are up to 4.5  times as severe as the general population of U.S. children of the same  age.Â  </em>We  found that lack of water fluoridation and frequent soda-pop consumption were  strongly associated with dental cavities severity in five rural Alaska Native  villages.Â  Children from villages without  fluoridated water had up to three times more cavities than children from  villages with fluoridated water.Â  While  water fluoridation is an effective and relatively inexpensive method of  reducing dental cavities, many rural Alaska Native villages have no in-home  water or sanitation systems which prevent these villages from fluoridating.  Because of this, additional preventive services, such as providing fluoride  varnishes, are necessary to improve the dental health of these children. </p>

<h4 id="three">3. FDA Approval of Expanded Age Indication for a Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine</h4>

<p><em>Pertussis (whooping cough)  is the least well-controlled bacterial vaccine-preventable disease in the United  States.Â  </em>Pertussis is highly contagious and can cause serious or prolonged  illness.Infants, especially those too young to be vaccinated, are at  increased risk for death from pertussis.Â   To prevent pertussis transmission to infants, all close contacts (e.g.,  parents, siblings, grandparents) should make sure they are vaccinated.Â  Persons aged 11 through 64 years are  routinely recommended to receive a one-time dose of Tdap vaccine in place of a  Td booster.Â  Persons aged 65 years and  older who have or who anticipate having close contact with an infant are  recommended to receive a dose of Tdap vaccine.Â   BOOSTRIX (GlaxoSmithKline) has been available to persons aged 11 through  64 years and is now approved for use in adults aged 65 years and older. By getting vaccinated with Tdap, adolescents  and adults can protect themselves against pertussis, in turn preventing  pertussis exposure to infants too young to be vaccinated.</p>
