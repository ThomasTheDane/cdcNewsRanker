If so, you'll want to learn more about food groups.</p><p>This section helps explain the food groups based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010 and provides information about food plans. There are five groups consisting of vegetables, fruits, grains, dairy and a protein group which includes meat, poultry, fish and nuts. <a href="http://www.choosemyplate.gov">MyPlate</a> illustrates the five food groups that are the building blocks for a healthy diet using a familiar imageâa place setting for a meal âand display how much of each food group you need to eat for a healthy diet.</p><h2>What are the basic food groups?</h2><table cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><th align="left" scope="col">Food Groups</th><th align="left" colspan="2" scope="col">Examples</th></tr><tr><td align="left" scope="row" valign="top"><strong><a href="http://www.choosemyplate.gov/food-groups/vegetables.html">Vegetables</a></strong></td><td valign="top">The vegetables you eat may be fresh, frozen, canned or dried and may be eaten whole, cut-up, or mashed.

Examples include broccoli, carrots, collard greens, split peas, green beans, black-eyed peas, kale, lima beans, potatoes, spinach, squash, sweet potatoes, tomatoes and kidney beans. Any vegetable or 100% vegetable juice counts in this group.</td><td align="center" scope="row" valign="top"><img alt="Vegetables" border="0" height="76" src="/nutrition/images/food_groups_vegetables.jpg" width="125"/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" scope="row" valign="top"><strong><a href="http://www.choosemyplate.gov/food-groups/fruits.html">Fruits</a></strong></td><td valign="top">The fruits you eat may be fresh, canned, frozen or dried and may be eaten whole, cut-up, or pureed.
