             <p>Pre-event preparation, training, and access to readily available information, field assessment, and safety equipment are critical to minimizing consequent deaths, injuries, and illnesses, and to promote overall workforce resilience. Once the event occurs the responders are then placed under a time-urgent, dual-cognitive demand:1) they must attend to the hazards (including attention to self and crew members' safety and health), and 2) they must perform the work necessary to complete a rescue. In the post-event stage (72 hours after the incident), responders may assess potential exposures, conduct rescues, and attempt recovery activities in constantly changing and complex hazardous environments.</p>

           <p><a href="/niosh/npptl/guidancedocs/rand.html">Protecting Emergency Responders Safety Management in Disaster and Terrorism Response</a><br/>
      NIOSH and RAND produced four reports in a series. The first three reports provide recommendations and the need for research, training and other strategic approaches to help protect emergency responders in terrorist attacks. The fourth report is a technical source for incident commander guidelines for emergency response immediately following large structural collapse events. Each individual report can be accessed using the following links:</p>
