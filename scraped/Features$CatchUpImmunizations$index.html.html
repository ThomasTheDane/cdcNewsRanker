School-age children, from preschoolers to college students, need vaccines. Use CDCâs online resources and tools to check the recommended vaccines for your children. Get your children to the doctor if you discover they need vaccines to protect them against serious diseases.</p><h3>What All Parents Need To Know</h3><p><img alt="Photo: Mother saying goodbye to daughter at school" class="stroke righty" height="269" src="/features/catchupimmunizations/catchupimmunizations_b200px.jpg" title="Photo: Mother saying goodbye to daughter at school" width="200"/>Making sure that children of all ages receive all their vaccinations on time is one of the most important things you can do as a parent to ensure your children's long-term healthâas well as the health of friends, classmates, and others in your community.</p><p>To keep children in schools healthy, your state may require children going to school to be vaccinated against certain diseases, such as whooping cough. If you're unsure of your state's school requirements, now is the time to check with your child's doctor, your child's school, or your health department. That way, you can get your child any vaccines he needs before the back-to-school rush.</p><h3>Disease Outbreaks Still Happen</h3><p>It's true that some vaccine-preventable diseases have become very rare thanks to vaccines. However, outbreaks still happen. For example, data from 2012 show that more than 48,000 cases of whooping cough (pertussis) were reported in this country and many more cases go unreported. During that year, 20 deaths were reportedâthe majority of which were in children younger than 3 months of age. Outbreaks of pertussis at middle and high schools can occur as protection from childhood vaccines fades.</p><p>Making sure your children stay up to date with vaccinations is the best way to protect your communities and schools from other outbreaks that can cause unnecessary illnesses and deaths.</p><h3>Vaccines for Your Young Children (Newborns through 6 years old)</h3><p>During the early years of life, your children need vaccines to protect them from 14 diseases that can be serious, even life-threatening. Parents who choose not to vaccinate their own children increase the risk of disease not only for their children, but also for other children and adults throughout the entire community. For example, vulnerable newborns too young to have received the maximum protection from the recommended doses of vaccines or people with weakened immune systems, such as some people with cancer and transplant recipients, are also at higher risk of disease.</p><p>Flu vaccines are recommended for kids in preschool and elementary school to help keep them healthy. In fact, all children 6 months and older should get flu vaccines. Getting all of your children vaccinatedâas well as other family members and caregiversâcan help protect infants younger than 6 months old. Ask your family's doctor or nurse about getting flu shots or the nasal spray to protect against flu.</p><p>Parents can find out what vaccines their children need and when the doses should be given by reviewing CDC's recommended <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/easy-to-read/child.html#print" target="_blank">Childhood Immunization Schedule</a>.</p><h3>Vaccines for Your Preteens and Teens (7 years old through 18 years old)</h3><p><img alt="Photo: Teenage students at lockers" class="stroke righty" height="300" src="/features/catchupimmunizations/catchupimmunizations_a200px.jpg" title="Photo: Teenage students at lockers" width="200"/>Older children need vaccines, too! Of course, everyone older than 6 months of age is recommended to receive a yearly flu vaccination, and older children are no exception. It's important to know that flu can be serious, even for healthy young people. So older kids should get at least one flu vaccine (the shot or nasal spray for healthy kids) every year.</p><p>As kids get older, they are more at risk for catching certain diseases, like meningococcal meningitis, so they need the protection that vaccines provide. The recommended immunization schedule is regularly updated to include new vaccines and reflect current research. It may have changed since your child was first immunized. Specific vaccines, like HPV, which helps protect against certain cancers, are recommended to be given during the preteen (11-12) years. If your preteens or teens haven't already gotten their vaccines, they should get caught up as soon as possible.</p><p>For other diseases, like whooping cough, the protection from vaccine doses received in childhood wears off over time. That's why 11- and 12-year-olds are also recommended to get the booster shot called Tdap. Teensâand adults, tooâwho have not gotten Tdap should get this booster as soon as possible. Tdap is a version of the DTaP vaccine given to infants and young children.</p><p>CDC provides an <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/easy-to-read/preteen-teen.html#print" target="_blank">immunization schedule for people ages 7 through 18 years</a> for parents and doctors to protect children and teens from vaccine-preventable disease.

If a child misses a shot, it can be difficult to figure out the best way to catch up. To help, CDC and colleagues at Georgia Tech have developed the <a href="https://www.vacscheduler.org/" target="_blank">Catch-Up Immunization Scheduler</a> <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/Other/disclaimer.html" target="_blank"></a>, an online tool that shows parents and healthcare providers the best options for getting children 6 years of age and younger back on schedule.</p><p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/Schedulers/adolescent-scheduler.html" target="_blank"><img alt="Graphic: Adolescent immunization scheduler.
