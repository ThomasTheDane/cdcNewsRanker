If antibiotics are used too often for things they can't treatâlike colds or other viral infectionsâthey can stop working effectively against bacteria when you or your child really needs them. Antibiotic resistanceâwhen antibiotics can no longer cure bacterial infectionsâhas been a concern for years and is considered one of the world's most critical <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/threat-report-2013/index.html">public health threats</a>.</p><p>CDC efforts have resulted in fewer children receiving unnecessary antibiotics in recent years, but inappropriate use remains a problem. Widespread overuse and inappropriate use of antibiotics continues to fuel an increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria.</p><p>Antibiotic resistance is also an economic burden on the entire healthcare system. Resistant infections cost more to treat and can prolong healthcare use.</p><h3>Video: Parents Want To Do What's Best</h3><p>When your child is sick, antibiotics may not be the answer. Work with your child's doctor or nurse to learn how you can help your child feel better. CDC created a 30-second TV public service announcement to highlight this important information.</p><div class="rx-row">

In fact, in children, antibiotics are the most common cause of emergency department visits for adverse drug events. Rest, fluids, and over-the-counter products may be your or your child's best treatment option.</p><div class="righty" style=" width: 200px;"><div class="module rounders">
