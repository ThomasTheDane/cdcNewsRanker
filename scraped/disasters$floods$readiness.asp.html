Ask an out-of-state relative or friend to be the "family contact" in case your family is separated during a flood. Make sure everyone in your family knows the name, address, and phone number of this contact person.</li><li>Post emergency phone numbers at every phone.</li><li>Inform local authorities about any special needs, i.e., elderly or bedridden people, or anyone with a disability.</li><li><img alt="Photo of notes on the Side of a Refrigerator." class="margin-ten fancy-border-right" src="/disasters/floods/images/notes.jpg"/>Identify potential home hazards and know how to secure or protect them before the flood strikes. Be prepared to turn off electrical power when there is standing water, fallen power lines, or before you evacuation. Turn off gas and water supplies before you evacuate. Secure structurally unstable building materials.</li><li>Buy a fire extinguisher and make sure your family knows where it is and how to use it.</li><li>Buy and install sump pumps with back-up power.</li><li>Have a licensed electrician raise electric components (switches, sockets, circuit breakers and wiring) at least 12" above your home's projected flood elevation.</li><li>For drains, toilets, and other sewer connections, install backflow valves or plugs to prevent floodwaters from entering.</li><li>Anchor fuel tanks which can contaminate your basement if torn free. An unanchored tank outside can be swept downstream and damage other houses.</li></ul><p><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="watchwarning" name="watchwarning" title="Under Watches &amp; Warnings"></a><span class="toTop"><span class="icon-angle-up"><!-- --></span>Â <a href="#">Top of Page</a></span></p><h3>If you are under a flood watch or warning:</h3><ul><li>Gather the emergency supplies you previously stocked in your home and stay tuned to local radio or television station for updates.</li><li>Turn off all utilities at the main power switch and close the main gas valve if evacuation appears necessary.</li><li>Have your immunization records handy or be aware of your last tetanus shot, in case you should receive a puncture wound or a wound becomes contaminated during or after the flood.</li><li>Fill bathtubs, sinks and plastic soda bottles with clean water.
